dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2024-04-10T01:57:24Z,Samsung Galaxy S21 doesn&#39;t have 3x Telephoto lens. It only has 64MP 1.1X (Wide camera but used as Telephoto and uses sensor crop for hybrid zoom)
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2024-03-31T20:14:37Z,Very good i really like the video

dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2024-02-25T00:59:55Z,Hahha so you will barley notice the plastic üòÇ how much they paid you
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2024-01-31T20:07:42Z,The Galaxy S21 doesn&#39;t have a <b>&quot;laser autofocus&quot;</b> because technically it doesn&#39;t need it.. the dual pixel autofocus is way faster than the ultra. Only reason the ultra needed a laser autofocus was because of its ridiculously large sensor that was plagued with focusing issues
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2024-01-27T20:35:48Z,I have a s21 and a s22 i dont feel any difference üòÇ
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2024-01-22T04:17:09Z,I love the colour combination on S21 Plus. Perfecto
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2024-01-09T19:42:15Z,Hello everybody. I found this one for 250‚Ç¨ black color in a great condition what to do?
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2024-01-04T04:24:36Z,S21 and iPhone 11 which one has the better camera?
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2024-01-01T21:24:32Z,I am thinking the reason for the price drop is because of failed software updates from the providers. Hopefully Google will take this part over from the carriers to resolve this type of issue when you move from one(TM) carrier to another(ATT). Mine is a 21+5g and still shows no update past version 12 and it was released with ver11. I am working on finding a manual update process since ATT or Samsung has no fix for me other than a sw reflash thru ifixitü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2023-12-31T14:06:08Z,This is the best old samsung flagship to get for cheap rn going into 2024
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2023-12-17T18:02:43Z,"I have S10+ and looking for my next phone. I&#39;m looking at the S20+ and it looks OK despite the lack of headphone port. Now,= with S21,  they got rid of the SD card slot and only offer 256GB of storage? Oh and plastic, and 1080p display? C&#39;mon. <br><br>Oh, and the ones with 256GB cost twice as much as those with 128GB, because nobody wants an unexpandable phone with only 128GB. Obviously, Samsung crippled the S21. It was the coronavirus, so they wanted to simplify things, but S21 is a backward step, so I&#39;m sticking with my S10, and I&#39;ll probably upgrade to S20, and then hold it for dear life for the rest of time."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2023-10-17T11:37:00Z,Focus. I think the S21 trumps the vultra on focus

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2023-08-05T02:45:33Z,I think that the camera is far less superior than the new 2023 motarola razr+. it just cannot compare to such astonishing  flipping design which is also better than the folding experience

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2023-06-13T14:23:43Z,The display on the S 21 causes white spots in my vision and pain in my eyes within about 20 minutes. The display on my S-10 I could stare at for 6 hours with no problems.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2023-04-05T18:31:48Z,I think on the Android side Samsung really does do the most box checking. They are very much the apple of the Android world.
dhAmMXCBIcg,28,2023-04-05T10:03:09Z,I ain&#39;t got the money for the s22 or the S23 but switching from the A41 to the S21 seems really good for that price range. <br>Thanks for the review

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2023-01-08T22:30:23Z,"Marques, your reviews&#39; video quality keeps improving, and that is indeed something that always impresses me, however, please know and understand that not everyone is that crazy about cameras. This is something i&#39;ve been noticing but you have a bias when it comes to cameras. if a phone is good for taking pictures, you would rate it highly whether it actually deserves such a rating or not.<br>I bought this phone (exynos version) and i am NOT happy with what i got. Performance you say is Good, which can&#39;t be farther than the truth here. Now to be fair, what i got was exynos version, and i use it for a lot of things like gaming, running benchmarks, testing software etc.<br><br>Re gaming, this phone just dies. Especially genshin impact, tower of fantasy. It is damn near unplayable and when it is playable, just not enjoyable due to lag and low fps. I tested the same games on older one plus phones, and the difference was night and day. older one plus phones outperformed this new phone every time. moreover the samsung software related to games is extremely bad. that is one of the reasons for these bad performances. genshin impact overclocks at 45fps. 30fps it says is smooth load wise, however, game experience is terrible.<br><br>Re battery, it is awful. i have to charge multiple times a day and have to watch my  usage to make sure i don&#39;t run out of battery when outside. not reliable whatsoever. There are also some issues with software it seems where sometimes it would get stuck, heat up, and then attempt to restart, and doing so would drain massive percentages of battery. heating up is a problem as well in general. sometimes google maps drains massive amounts of battery, like 1% per minute even. very inconsistent.<br><br>Re Camera, it has been quite decent for the most part, however, it too drains battery very fast. if you do long sessions of photography, forget it, or keep a power source with you all times. Camera is quite inconsistent sometimes, which i suspect is owed to software updates. sometimes i would get great shots, and sometimes its just bad.<br><br>Design wise, i quite like it. it&#39;s a beautiful design. however, when it is heating up, due to metal rails, the whole phone gets heated and is uncomfortable to hold even.<br><br>I would suggest you do proper stress testing of the devices, and if it&#39;s not possible, please at least add a disclaimer that you have not tested it. I do realize that there are differences in SD and exynos however, the differences are not as big that all the above points i mentioned would be fixed by them (a friend used SD version as well).<br><br>Also, there are heating issues reported in devices with SD 888. All i can say is, please provide complete information. I really feel bad about this purchase, and it wasn&#39;t cheap.<br>everyday performance is silky smooth though, however, if i just want to scroll through news feed, i can do that with a $200 phone as well, why would i have to go the extra mile?! well, i&#39;m gonna use this one until the phone expires, however, next phone i&#39;m buying won&#39;t be samsung that&#39;s for sure."

dhAmMXCBIcg,21,2022-12-11T14:01:59Z,I have had a phantom white Samsung S21 for 2 years so far and still runs well with the Exynos 2100 cpu. I&#39;m hoping I can trade it in for a S23+ or something in the new S23 lineup because it is rumored that we may get blessed with a snapdragon cpu in the S23 lineup.

dhAmMXCBIcg,3,2022-11-05T08:56:03Z,"Dude you are literally the definition of a sell out. If you spent longer than a month using this phone you would (probably already do) know its absolute garbage. My old motorola g5 works better than this overpriced waste of space. I&#39;ve already gotten it replaced and and the battery life lasts me half the day if I&#39;m lucky and dont use it that much. It constantly  updates randomly without approval (like while your driving) and lacks greatly in very basic functionality you would expect from a smart phone. For example the alarm doesn&#39;t work. The UI is laggy and unresponsive at times. Daily I have to restart it just to get it to work. Essentially all its good for is texting and calling and some very light web browsing. For some people thats fine. But is it worth the price they ask for? hell no. Its worth $100 at most and thats even pushing it. Take it from me... Owning this phone will bring you nothing but stress. Avoid it and avoid douche bags like this that just get phones sent to him for free to make shitty reviews that result in people buying horrible products and bring no value to their life. It might sound harsh, but we rely on our phones so much these days just for work etc. It really irritates me to see someone with this many subscribers who literally couldn&#39;tt care less for a single one of the people bringing him all that money. YOU are FAKE sir. Hope you sleep like a baby at night to you spineless POS."
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2022-11-05T01:13:37Z,It is funny to me how they keeps saying this is a compact phone. I am &quot;still&quot; using the S9+ with the same screen size and I can barely use it with one hand ü§£

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-10-21T02:11:40Z,cheaper S21+ second hand(Exynox) or brand new S21(SD888). S21 being $150ish more expensive. Which one is a greater buy?

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-06-21T06:40:52Z,"Hello there fellow Android users, and iPhone supremacists here to poke fun and troll...üòÖ <br><br>After being an iPhone user since the 6s...with this phone I&#39;m kinda like...&quot;Whaaaaat..??&quot; The last Android I had was the Galaxy S4 way back in 2014 or whatever, and since then I had the iPhone 6s, XS, and 11 Pro Max...which I ended up breaking in a horrible accident that I still cringe about to this very moment...One thing that I REALLY like in a smartphone is it&#39;s camera capabilities...I had heard for the longest that the newest Samsung&#39;s cameras definitely defined themselves over the iPhone&#39;s. And after now having the Galaxy S 21 for close to 2 weeks now, I have indeed been able to snap some great shots; the Night shot quality surprised me the most...It&#39;s totally a quality picture taking device!<br><br>As an admitted Apple fanboy, I&#39;m trying my VERY best to go about enjoying this phone as much as I can...But...I STILL am having a HARD time getting over missing my iOS...!!! ü•≤Can some of you; ESPECIALLY those of you who were previous iPhone owners who made the switch to Android please speak to me a little bit on what exactly makes you prefer this phone and the overall Android system over Apple and it&#39;s iOs? I REALLY wanna know! I know that there is absolutely ALL KINDS of things this phone can do, that I simply have NO IDEA of how to go about bringing to the forefront, or even using...PERIOD. I&#39;ve SOMEHOW got to get acquainted with this phone, as I don&#39;t plan on purchasing another smartphone for many, many years. But yeah, can some of you just please tell me, a brand new Android user after years of owning iPhones just what exactly it is that you all you like regarding this phone and Android in general over the iPhone and iOS? I&#39;d appreciate it very much! Thank you all in advance! üòÉüì±üì≤"

I maybe used it a handful of times with my Galaxy S10 Plus phone but it was a nice feature to have when the store didn&#39;t have a NFC-compatible card reader (but I don&#39;t miss getting yelled at by the cashier saying their card reader doesn&#39;t support mobile payments)."

The amount of features you get over IOS is amazing!"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-03-04T13:12:58Z,I like the dual sim card. Either for a work phone or canceling your service provider for whatever reason.  <br>I also like using this as my modem for my pc. You connect it with the charging wire into your pc USB and just like plugging into a phone jack. You now have internet access. <br>Great phone.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-02-18T22:15:46Z,Lets just review S21 after watching S22 üòé
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-02-18T03:38:41Z,Wait only 48 to 120 hrz ...
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-02-17T11:37:49Z,"Great review as always! I appreciate very much the way you share these &quot;different&quot; points of view that really helps people like me (normal devices users) to really look at what &quot;really matters&quot; when buying your next phone.<br>And by the way I&#39;m in the process of doing it....and, I&#39;m quite stuck. So here are my doubts, if anyone would drop a line...<br><br>I owned only 2 smartphones in my life: A Samsung S3 bought in 2012 and a Samsung S8 Plus bought in 2018 (few months after S9 was launched). This phone is awesome. Great camera, great display, great everything. I wouldn&#39;t change it yet but...it dropped one time more than it could resist and now the screen and the back are gone. Long gone. The display looks analog and glass debris  are falling...really bad. My fault. I should have kept in a decent case. So, good rule for the next one: keep it in a good case and maybe no more glass on the back at last.<br><br>I was waiting for the S21 FE (my wife bought a S20 FE, another great product!) but when 21FE came out my expectations dropped: 4 horrible colors, no SD and no 256 GB storage (only 128GB). It&#39;s slightly greater than S21 which is ok for me coming from S8 plus. Then S22 came out and I understood that S21/Plus price will fall soon...indeed. <br><br>Apparently S21 (256GB) is the phone that most meets my requirements. Honestly, I was thinking about the Plus version as I like the 6.7 inch display (same as S20 FE), very good for video, but as I said before I&#39;m going to stay away from glass back.<br><br>Alternatives to Samsung that can really be compared to S21/S21 Plus?<br>At the moment I&#39;m looking at the Motorola Edge 20 Pro...Opinions? Thanks!"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-02-15T21:56:42Z,"I&#39;m just now watching this, and it&#39;s sad that he didn&#39;t even understand why Samsung lowered the price. They lowered it because they thought with the S20 that they commanded sufficient market power to raise the price, however Apple laughed at them and left their prices the same. This made Samsung look terrible, so they had no choice but to go back to reasonable pricing.<br><br>Come on, now. Use some brainpower."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-02-15T17:23:20Z,Is this called 21 cuz iit was year 2021
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-02-13T19:15:24Z,Over a year later and I came back for that intro

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-02-11T14:50:31Z,i really love your wallpaper on your s21 where can i get that same wallpaper because i can never find it? i actually have the s21 in the white color and i am loving it so far the only issue that i have is the software updates but overall its my favorite by the way i love how honest you are about the phone i basically watch your review everyday im a big fan and i will for sure subscribe to your channel
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2022-02-11T12:26:22Z,Who else is watching this now because they are thinking of buying the s21 ultra for cheaper because the s22 is out now ?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-02-11T03:21:06Z,Was the screen not too small?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-02-10T01:46:17Z,Thank you for the translation into Arabic and all thanks and appreciation to you
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2022-02-09T22:18:25Z,I&#39;m not usually a flagship phone person (coming from a series of moto Gs) but I just picked this up in early 2022 for $300... really solid deal and I&#39;m impressed with the hardware so far...
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-02-09T17:20:04Z,Just upgraded on Google fi from note 20 5g. It&#39;s only $249 or $18 with trade in. I hate the bigger screen and phone. I needed something smaller. Hurting my arthritic thumb. Very fast nice phone.
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2022-02-09T15:43:21Z,I hate I wasted my money on the piece of shit. It was supposed to have a good camera but every document I take a photo of comes out blurry so iv had to start using my 3 year old iPad for photos instead
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2022-02-08T17:09:40Z,i have noticed that the zoom of the samsung s20 fe is better than the s21

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2022-01-31T10:15:16Z,I&#39;m upgrading to this from a G7. Hoping the extra dough gains me some better  reception and data speed. The Motorola has been great but the battery is starting to go and reception seems to be decreasing (maybe due to 5g expansion?). <br><br>The Samsung shined in software updates and networking capability over the rest of the pack. Definitely looking forward to the wireless charging.

IT&quot;S nothing more than a commercial for samsung.  all your links are about KICKBACKS!!    shame on you taking a huge dump on your followers..   they took off the SD card slot so you have to PAY MORE MONEY FOR CLOUD SUBSCRIPTIONS and ALL of your info  pics and other things you keep on your phone are more vulnerable to hack or for the FBI and other government agencies to monitor... good luck with that..

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2022-01-22T15:40:12Z,It&#39;s finny that much older Samsung Galaxy S9+ has much better resolution than any of S21 phones.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-01-22T04:19:45Z,"S21 is having major mobile network issues, seems to be either from One UI update or issue with the actual antenna. Alot of people are experiencing issues and have been for a couple months. Samsung support says they cannot do anything but suggest sending in device.  They need to be recalled."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-01-20T18:35:00Z,What would you pick? a S21 or a Pixel 5? what are the pros and cons vs eachother?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2022-01-20T05:03:59Z,Nope...s20 is lighter

And i also bought this one because it was 30% off, so 790 bucks less than the ultra on january sale. So now i watch reviews to see what has changed since note 8 which was my last sammy. So i think i made the deal of the year on the sammy line lol"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-12-27T17:51:18Z,"I&#39;ve been using Samsung S21 for a month now and it&#39;s great! I bought it for 700$ and I think it is wort that price. I considered buying iphone 12 mini, 12 or 13 mini, but i didn&#39;t do that cause I wouldn&#39;t experience all featuers of Apple&#39;s ecosystem since I don&#39;t like apple&#39;s pc-s or laptops, imo they are not worth the price, and their specifications are weak compared to self - built pc-s like mine. One feature of s21 complitely disqualified Iphones for me. 120hz refresh rate. The cheapest iphone that has it is 13 pro that costs 999$ or more. Using a phone with only 60hz refreshrate after using 120hz is teribble."

dhAmMXCBIcg,4,2021-12-26T06:14:01Z,Very informative video. I just upgraded from my S9 to the S21.  I was hesitant due to the lack of expandable storage. Dropping that really disappoints me with Samsung.  Hopefully the rest of the phones functions make up for that.
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-12-24T20:01:11Z,But I feel that Samsung is better than iPhone
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-12-24T20:00:39Z,Samsung is really doing a great Job.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-12-23T23:48:01Z,I really like how you don&#39;t talk down on any phone.. You really give a nice review on the phones you review..  Spending over a 1000 on  a phone is  a hard thing to swallow for most people.  Also most You Tubers like to push the flag ship phones only and talk down on anything but... Drives me crazy.  People have different needs so reivews like this are GREAT !
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-12-23T20:52:16Z,I&#39;m deciding on whether to get the S21 or wait for the S22.  I&#39;m running an S10e. I need advice please.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-12-23T16:55:09Z,MKBHD. Is it just me or is the S21 screen not symmetrical?!?... I really think the top right ad left curves are not symmetrical. Bottom corners though... debatable. Who else better to ask for help with such a task hehe.<br><br>PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS... prove me wrong cos im going insane! Thanks.

And when I tell you I&#39;m over iphone, I&#39;m OVER it, I&#39;m so ready for the switch. I spent an hour looking at different models and specs, even spoke to a couple chat agents for some recommendations and whatnot, all without much help. Came to ole reliable youtube and just started watching reviews on certain phones and I think I found the one I&#39;m gonna get. Shopping online is so overrated, it&#39;s easy to overlook things and get lost in the sea of listed models and specs without being able to see the actual phone and it&#39;s performance. This was super helpful!"

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-11-22T20:35:38Z,Samsung was my favorite company until I turned on my s10 this year. I had bought it brand new when it came out however my s8 lasted 2 more years so never felt the need to switch. The s10 is garbage. Constantly the wifi drops down to levels that are unusable. 2-20 mbs dl when I have close to 1000mbps on any other device. I have to hard reset the phone and magicly wifi is fine for a few hours atleast. SAMSUNG acts a fool when I call yet many other people have experienced this problem. RIP SAMSUNG. This is what happens when you kick a 10 year custumer to the curve. I&#39;m putting RCA stickers over everything SAMSUNG in my house.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-11-16T23:52:06Z,Expandable storage is better than cloud because it can&#39;t be hacked if it&#39;s not in a device. The cloud can be hacked easier because it doesn&#39;t require access to your phone to get the files from the cloud.  Bad move on the expandable storage in my opinion.

Also  there&#39;s no headphone jack so everything has to be bluetooth which I hate because personally I find bluetooth to lose quality in listening to music compared to a jack.

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-10-13T18:05:05Z,He always puts a lot of emphasis on the cameras. I&#39;m just wondering how much of the community actually uses their cameras on their phones. I would bet money that MKBHD uses his phone cameras more in one day than I have my entire life. Love the content just wondering.

dhAmMXCBIcg,9,2021-10-05T03:05:35Z,"I&#39;ve never commented on any video of but thought why not. After pretty much 1000 video reviews from a variety of phones across the board his reviews are always down to the point, sharing information after using the device that is in my opinion relevant and for the most part eliminates confusion / second thoughts for any smartphone. Lastly what I like and have respect for is reviews like these coming from an Apple user never waters down any Android operating device review. Double thumbs up!"

Also this thing has face unlock right? Google &amp; Apple currently make you choose. I&#39;ve used Huawei P10 &amp; P30 for 4 years now. While they&#39;re not perfect (lack of updates now, slow/buggy IG, File Browser and apps) sometimes they definitely nail the hardware specs."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-09-29T01:01:44Z,I really am bummed about the laser auto focus missing from this phone. Really don&#39;t know why they decided to leave it out
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-09-28T23:52:36Z,just wish the edges were black
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-09-28T21:42:17Z,So the camera that&#39;s it? I&#39;ve had my Samsung s10e(128GB) for 1.5 years now and still world fine

dhAmMXCBIcg,9,2021-09-27T20:33:31Z,I really appreciate this review. I was waffling between the ultra and the regular s21 and this solidified my decision to go with the regular one. I&#39;m currently using a iphone 8 so anything will be a big jump I imagine!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-09-27T18:49:20Z,"No NFC, no sharper resolution, and no expandable storage, on top of no headphone jack? If it could zoom to the moon, I&#39;d consider it, but other than that, this thing is a horrible deal in my opinion. I&#39;m sticking with my S9."
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-09-26T10:21:03Z,Wanted to buy it but then I found out it doesn&#39;t come with a charger. Went immediately for something different.

dhAmMXCBIcg,3,2021-09-21T22:49:15Z,"Thanks for the review. I&#39;m about to get this a few days from now and was curious about functionality. I currently still have a galaxy note 9 and I still love it. I&#39;m glad the s21 isn&#39;t gonna be too much smaller bcuz I like larger screens. I also don&#39;t wanna give up the stylus pen and headphone jack but I use Galaxy buds anyway. I think I&#39;ll still keep my note 9 also bcuz the s21 doesn&#39;t have expandable storage. That was almost a deal breaker for me. We&#39;ll see how it goes to. I prefer the s21 ultra, but like I said, we&#39;ll see how it goes. I&#39;m definitely gonna keep both of my phones tho"
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-09-21T22:48:56Z,"I started watching these reviews back in highschool when a 4.7 inch display was big simply because the iphone was a 3.5 inch display.<br><br>Hearing &quot;so it is a little smaller&quot; in regards to a freaking 6.2 inch display is so insane to me. <br><br>Tbh I&#39;m nostalgic for the smaller easier to hold phones I miss how comfortably the moto x gen 1 fit in the hand, no pop socket just a little dimple in the plastic."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-09-19T06:46:05Z,Just curious cuz I&#39;m thinking about getting this phone now of upgrading my S10. So they got rid of the waterfall display from on the s21 on all of them?ü§î
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-09-19T02:57:30Z,"I got a s21 on the way in the mail.... Upgrading from the galaxy S9 plus,"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-09-19T01:09:53Z,Strongly considering getting this over an iPhone for my next upgrade. iPhones are limited and basic its frustrating seeing everything you can do on android devices while I currently have an iPhone
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-09-18T18:01:59Z,About time they got rid of that breakable glass back. Attic is fine. You put a case on it anyway
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-09-18T17:06:06Z,The screen is too near the bazel. I keep accidentally clicking on something
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-09-18T04:28:54Z,"I have S10, hate the front camera, while watching your video in landscape mode it gets in the middle of the way(the position of the camera)"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-09-15T22:49:07Z,"Bro I have an s9+ (bought it when it was released before) and it&#39;s still really good but in 2 years I would have to make the switch. <br><br>I was hoping they&#39;d bring back the audio jack but they didn&#39;t. <br><br>Wireless is fun and all but these are battery dependent. Which means overtime I would have to keep replacing. In fact, I&#39;ve replaced my Samsung buds and airpods pro 2x already... like bruh it isn&#39;t financially friendly and it definitely isn&#39;t eco-friendly as I keep throwing my old TWS headsets. <br><br>I have a wired earphones and I was able to keep them in good condition for 4 years now. I even have a 6 yr old earphones. <br><br>Fck me I would hate to change to a phone with no audio jack......"
dhAmMXCBIcg,3,2021-09-15T18:41:04Z,"After &quot;upgrading&quot; from my S9+ I instantly regretted it. Seriously how are these downgrades &quot;not noticeable&quot;?<br><br>First of all, the 1080p screen was obvious, I can see discolouration around texts where I couldn&#39;t see on the S9+ and things look pixelated. I used pop up window frequently (or at least used to) but at 1080p I can barely make out text unless I go full screen.<br><br>Secondly, SD card slot was a big deal breaker. I used to be able to transfer all my stuff in less than a second by slotting the SD card inside, now it takes an hour to transfer everything over.<br><br>Thirdly, the removal of the charger was a terrible move. They included a C to C cable which is incompatible with the charger that came with my S9+.<br><br>Lastly, the proximity sensor on this is horrendous. The screen doesn&#39;t turn on when I pull it away from my ear like my S9+ used to.<br><br>If Samsung keeps downgrading and removing features my next phone won&#39;t be a Samsung and that&#39;s for sure."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-09-07T08:10:31Z,What I don&#39;t like about the S21 is the lack of headphone jacks. Are they too much to ask for these days? And my calls get dropped and go silent from faulty software.
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-09-07T05:49:02Z,"He&#39;s 100% right, I got my S21 a week ago, didn&#39;t even realize that it was a plastic back until I saw this video."
dhAmMXCBIcg,3,2021-09-06T19:51:22Z,"Just got this phone, it replaced my S10e. I only have one complaint, the in screen sensor is not as good as the dedicated button was on the S10e and that&#39;s disappointing. However, although some people dislike the use of a plastic backing, I really like it."

I currently have an iPhone X model, not XS, XS Max, Max, etc. Just the 10 and I honestly don&#39;t have an opinion on the phone itself. I&#39;ve had it for 3 years now and it&#39;s honestly just boring. I&#39;ve mostly ever owned Apple phones/ipods/tablets/etc. Not because I was quote on quote &quot;wealthy&quot; but because they used to be the cheapest phones in the market when I was little.<br><br>My opinions on Androids changed when I first owned one. I used to be extremely classist toward Android products. When I first owned a LG Stylo 3, I really enjoyed it. The customization, performance, stability, and overall phone. At the time the phone was the best phone compared to the iPhone 5c I had previously owned.<br><br>I&#39;ve always been a non-classist person when it comes to technology. I&#39;ve always loved anything that works good enough for myself because nothing is really &#39;the best&#39; in [said year] because it&#39;s all completely opinion based. :)"

The only reason I got it was because I got a better deal upgrading with my network provider, in the sense I got more data for less money. If it wasn&#39;t for that, I wouldn&#39;t have upgraded.

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-08-09T15:59:55Z,No expandable SD Card WE ALL NOTICE. Samsung dropped the ball and their sales will suffer this year and you are wrong WE ALL NOTICE
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-08-09T15:57:47Z,WE ALL NOTICE WE ALL NOTICE - Stop saying we will not notice
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-08-09T15:56:31Z,The back is plastic but you will hardly notice. The resolution is less but you will hardly notice. The screen size is smaller but you will hardly notice. WE ALL NOTICE. No Note 21 WE ALL NOTICE. No 8k video on fold 3 and a 4mp selfie camera. WE ALL NOTICE. Goodbye Samsung I am looking to spend my money somewhere else.

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-08-05T22:01:11Z,"I&#39;ve got buyers remorse after using the S21 for a few months. Should have purchased the new LG flagship. I had the much older G6 which I had to use again because my S21 had to be shipped to Samsung and repaired. Warning, don&#39;t even put the S21 in a humid room or by the pool. I was splashed with droplets of water and the S21 gave me the dreaded, Moisture Detection error where you can only charge your phone via wirelessly. Isn&#39;t the phone supposed to survive being submerged in three feet of water for 30 minutes scenario? Yeah, I don&#39;t think so."

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-07-10T21:10:22Z,1440 vs 1080..... I constantly switch between res and notizen nothing.  So 1080 is fine for every smartphone

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-07-06T23:01:43Z,Currently using the base s21 us version as my main phone I wouldn&#39;t  get any other phone it&#39;s amazing
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-07-06T17:59:06Z,I admire Samsung phones! They are so much better in every way than Xiaomi Hawaii and others mid-range phones. The new Samsung A72 is improved so much. I owen it for a while abd i love it
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-07-06T15:15:30Z,Plastic back is actually better right because the glass backs are soooo expensive to replace
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-07-06T03:01:06Z,"This almost feels like it&#39;s inspired by OnePlus&#39;s ethos - skipping a few of the more niche/high-end features to cut the price, but investing in the right areas and deeply considering design so that it still feels like flagship material."
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-07-05T15:46:47Z,Watch this at school only me and 2 other people knew the channel
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-07-05T07:10:17Z,I love my s21 but i hate that my s10 screen looks so much more better compared too the s21s <br>I noticed the plastic and mainly that they only put the best screen on the s21 ultra the one i wanted too go with but they had none in stock üòÇüòÇüòÖ
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-07-04T22:40:57Z,The single shot is maybe better on the fe than the ultra?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-07-03T19:53:11Z,Androids soon to be phased out.<br>DONT BUY.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-07-03T16:30:17Z,"I have the phone since release and I will say this phone is not worth it whatsoever, I used to own all Samsung back when the note 4 came out I had the note 5 too and those phones were way better than this. Reason for that is the screen glare, if I take this phone outside I can&#39;t see anything even with the brightness all the way up, on the note 4 and somewhat on the note 5 if glare were to get on the phone the phone would shine brighter that you actually couldn&#39;t see any glare but for some reason they took that feature off any new phone after those, battery life on the s21 sucks, it over heats like crazy if you multitask or have gps running and YouTube at the same time the phone overheats and closes all apps yet my one plus 5t is capable of doing that and more and not overheat at all why is that? Samsung&#39;s interface is so buggy that sometimes the keyboard disappears from me or the text message bubble gets in the way while watching videos or at times the bubble itself does not work and won&#39;t pop up unless you restart the phone, there is a lot wrong with this phone and I really do think Samsung should stop making yearly phones until they actually innovate I know they won&#39;t though they&#39;ll lose too much money üòí I give this phone 3/10."
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-07-03T14:43:26Z,Now I can afford the S10!
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-07-03T11:06:05Z,"I always had LG phones. G3 ,G6 and the G8. As LG has gotten out of the phone market and it was nearly impossible to get a LG phone thru Sprint / T-mobile I decided to get a Nord. Well I tell you the Nord was Disappointing to say the least. It was a Oneplus Nord 10. It had all kinds of trouble and wasn&#39;t reliable at all. So I began to search for a phone that was reliable, fast and fun to use . I considered Samsung. I saw the S 21 series and thought it looked good and the only thing that made me hesitate was the price<br> I wasn&#39;t sure I wanted to spend that much again. But upon looking I found the S21 . The lowest price of the three S21 models. In fact it was so much better in price by about 300.00. So I read reviews and took a chance and ordered one. I have had it a day and a half and I absolutely love it. The only thing I wish was they had it in the color I had ordered which was red not Salmon or whatever the heck it is. And I do wish that it&#39;s a larger screen because of my  vision but those are minor details and a bigger battery.  It&#39;s fast , crisp pictures and has plenty of storage for my use. I absolutely recommend this phone. It is right up there and even better in many ways compared to my LG G8. Okay some fewer features but to be honest I find I really don&#39;t miss them all that much and the best part is it works right from the start without and rebooting or other complications that I had with the One plus Nord 10. Heck yeah , I love this phone. Worth every penny.<br><br>Update. Have had for a week now and I have to say the battery on this is junk. It doesn&#39;t hold a.charge for long which is really pathetic  for a flagship phone<br>In 4 hours it&#39;s down to 50%. Not acceptable in today&#39;s market. Also I did the latest update and it removed google play and I can&#39;t update half of my apps. And it got rid of talk to text<br> I wish I had kept my LG G8. I KNOW WHAT I SAID BEFORE BUT LG WAS BETTER."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-07-02T19:13:55Z,"I waited for the perfect deal. 799.00 phone for O.00 - i paid 106.00 for taxes &amp; the 35.00 upgrade charge. I got 800.00 for my 300.00 Samsung A50. Unreal deal. I got a 100.00 credit. Sweet deal. Great video!!!!!!!!!! I ACTUALLY Prefer the smaller size phone, over the big phone in my front pocket all the time. I just bought a sweet Minolta 35 mm camera, so I do not need the ultra. So hyped."
dhAmMXCBIcg,14,2021-07-02T13:48:15Z,I recently picked up this phone under a new plan. Just waiting on it to arrive.  I initially thought about going with the s20 fe but after watching this review it puts me so much at ease that i went with the S21 instead.  Thank you so much.

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-07-01T01:31:42Z,Switched between QHD and FHD on my galaxy s9 plus and you cannot tell the difference. All higher resolution does is burn battery life. These screens are to small to make a difference. I&#39;m into tech and I upgraded to galaxy s21 plus for the lighter and smaller form factor. The Camera is good enough. Ultra is a brick.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-28T19:52:45Z,Finally got the s21 but the entire reason I debated not getting it was the camera bump I&#39;ve cleaned up more appealing cat vomit
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-28T18:35:37Z,Idk why anyone would prefer glass over plastic on something that takes so much abuse.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-28T17:47:02Z,I hate smasung bloatware.. Had samsung for years but now with less bloated Moto
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-27T23:38:06Z,Terrific review. Thank you ‚òò
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-06-27T08:53:37Z,phones are not exciting anymore. where are the 3D screens
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-27T06:04:32Z,"How about saying, I want a place for my square reader, and a place for my micro SD because I don&#39;t trust the cloud. This phone is not good period."
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-06-26T17:18:36Z,Laser autofocus removal is bad and at least they have given glass or metal or dropped the price more.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-26T15:48:39Z,By fastest chip in a phone you meant besides A14?
dhAmMXCBIcg,3,2021-06-26T14:30:23Z,"Love the heavy technical explanations in your videos. Very esthetically pleasing too, well done!"
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-06-26T12:28:42Z,Samsung with exynos is shit. I hate it
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-26T11:47:37Z,There is no smartview option
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-06-26T06:08:42Z,The telephoto is 1.1x optical zoom and 3x hybrid not 3x optical
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-26T06:06:34Z,I&#39;m sorry but a snapdragon 700 series on this phone would be completely unacceptable!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-25T04:11:55Z,Is this better than an iPhone XS?
dhAmMXCBIcg,18,2021-06-24T21:29:39Z,"First review of yours that I&#39;ve watched...needed to replace my A50 and found this. Top-notch review! I appreciate your straight-forward delivery. Gave me the information I was seeking while maintaining interest.  Initially planning on the A52 5G, but the not - stratospheric price plus features of the S21 5G including faster cpu, more ram, etc. made this an easy decision. I don&#39;t upgrade every 6 months (or year!) so long - term performance is a factor for me.  Plastic back?  Never saw the allure of a glass back, besides I always skin my phones anyway so back material is pretty much a non-issue to me."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-24T17:02:46Z,"Just upgraded to this from my s7 and will be picking up in a few days. Best buy has a sale going on, its 22 bucks a month for 2 years. 530 bucks!"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-24T16:24:17Z,I think the phone would have a bit more depth than the ultra
dhAmMXCBIcg,52,2021-06-24T02:10:55Z,I just love how samsung pulled itself out of China and launch this
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-23T16:11:49Z,We have these cool awesome content creators for tech but app developers wont optimize apps better for android üôÉ

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-22T14:12:21Z,ok so its my daily routine to come and watch  this intro

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-22T00:25:14Z,I just got this phone brand new in the box  for 460.00 did I get a good deal on it?

dhAmMXCBIcg,4,2021-06-21T20:36:33Z,"Coming from a s7 with QHD resolution I can say the difference in crispiness is really noticable. I would take QHD 60hz over 1080p 120hz any day. Hell I would even trade my s21 8g of ram with 4 GB of RAM and an old 765 Snapdragon without 5g if it meant getting QHD back at 60 Hz. You only really notice the 120hz when scrolling In the main menu (which you only really spend 5% of your time on your phone), in most apps 120hz is not that significant, so although 120hz is nice to have i really donc find it to be that significant. I went In the settings to set a 60hz refresh to save on battery life. All the other cuts Samsung made on the s21 I can happily live with but lowering that QHD res was a big mistake in my opinion."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-19T11:17:08Z,"I just upgraded from a GS10e to this Phone the GS21. I&#39;m not a camera person, so all the extra camera features in the + &amp; Ultra doesn&#39;t matter to me. I will say that this Phone is just as fast as my Laptop as far as Computing Goes. BTW, the Memory Storage is just as Big On This Phone As My Laptop."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-18T17:59:32Z,Does this phone S21  have edge panels feature?

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-11T03:58:49Z,I would rather have expandable storage for another (what)- fifty bucks? That‚Äôs a lot cheaper than paying for more storage.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-10T20:46:18Z,Hi please I have an s21 sm-g991b/ds but don&#39;t have esim feature. Why is that ?

dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-06-10T14:35:59Z,Sounds like a whole lot of sacrifices for a 200$ discount.
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-06-10T05:31:13Z,I currently have a Samsung J7 and knowing that I&#39;m going to get this phone in 2 weeks is just amazing. Such a massive upgrade. üòÇ
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-06-10T01:59:01Z,This phone is a FIREBALL! overheats just from browsing the web! Battery life sucks! Tons of users experience the same thing!
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-06-09T22:52:46Z,This phone is a piece of fucking shit. I always recommend galaxy phones been using them since the s3. This new one is fukn trash tho. Never will I ever buy another. Converting to a flip phone next month because I&#39;m so sick of these smart phone producers just chasing more money instead of quality.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-09T21:56:23Z,s10+ vs s21???

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-03T12:31:42Z,Love my s21. Went into the store to activate my new pixel 3 and they gave me an s21 instead for the pixel. Super siked. My s21 does run a bit warm tho
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-06-03T09:28:36Z,"the fact that a 6.2 inch phone is considered a &#39;small&quot; phone is just sad. at this rate, 7 inch phones might become the norm in the next 1-2 years.

dhAmMXCBIcg,6,2021-06-01T17:29:47Z,"It may be $200 cheaper compared to last years line. However, no micro SD card means one has to possibly spend money on cloud storage or a more expensive model. No charger means one has to, again, spend extra on one. No headphone jack or even basic included headphones  means one has to spend extra on overpriced wireless ones or adaptors - unless they get the S21 early. Besides, last year&#39;s line of flagships were quite overpriced. $1000+ is not okay. <br><br>Samsung is making even more money off this, not saving us anything. Sadly, they&#39;ve just emulated Apple&#39;s greed. This is all at the expense of loyal customers. I&#39;m done with Samsung."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-25T17:20:07Z,Random Day Random Thought: Let&#39;s watch MKBHD&#39;s S21 Review!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-25T16:37:42Z,"Selfies on my s21 plus are distorted (if it&#39;s 2+ people) , and on my daughters older iphone are not. FIX THIS SAMSUNG."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-25T13:40:47Z,They also cut out the ANT+ support for their entire lineup. Samsung were the last ones still having ANT+ built in so now you will have to use an USB dongle with new phones.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-25T02:25:55Z,How many years will this have support for? And even if it loses support will it still be usable?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-25T00:43:57Z,Where is my s20 gang at?!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-24T21:32:52Z,I can&#39;t afford itüò≠
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-24T21:19:14Z,Is it waterproof
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-24T16:17:16Z,"I can afford the s21 or the iphone 11 idk which one to get, but I just want to upgrade from my s9 with garbadge battery"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-24T10:31:50Z,"Im due an upgrade at the moment. I&#39;ve got the s10. Could do with a better camera and a decent battery is my main thing. I am looking at the options on what to get next, what do you suggest?<br>Thanks for sharing your thoughts üëç"
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-05-24T00:52:47Z,"Looking hard at upgrading to this from my S7, which is starting to feel a little bit sluggish. $100 with a trade-in seems like a good deal.<br><br>Anyone did this upgrade? How was it going from an S7 to an S21? And can you charge it with your S7 charger?"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-23T23:45:14Z,"I want one, but my S9 wont die or slow down..lol"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-23T21:34:36Z,Thank you so much for this. I always go to your channel everytime I&#39;m thinking of getting a new phone!
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-05-23T15:55:19Z,Best way to check a phones perfomance is to play genshin impact and see how long it takes the phone to run out of battery / heat up
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-05-23T15:41:41Z,Right I personally buy a flagship every 4 years. For the last 6 years I have been with iPhone and I must admit build quality on iPhone is the best but iOS no thanks so overall not my cup a tea . After doing my homework and avoiding Chinese brands I come with the conclusion that is time to go back to Samsung considering they made their s21 alit more affordable. Omg what I mistake that was !!!! I owned the s21 for 13hours and send it back . First and very important camera on low light is shocking it‚Äôs like 10 years ago all squares and blur and omg shocking . You play 5 min with the phone and is so hot that considering how light it is I always knew in what pocket it is coz it‚Äôs hot . Charging super slow . My wife had s10 3 years ago and I must admit it was a better phone everything with this phone is wrong . Let‚Äôs not forget that when u instal the latest update the screen will start jumping what a shock for a flagship. Also who on earth will manufacture same phone with 2 different processes??? And yes one is slightly better then the other. Mkbhd pls be honest with people because this is a joke of a phone what is why they are always on offer Samsung is trying their best to swift them . Mkbhd honest opinions pls this isn‚Äôt the phone is shocking!!!!

dhAmMXCBIcg,7,2021-05-21T19:07:06Z,Finally I can now afford the galaxy S7 edge or the S8 ‚úä
dhAmMXCBIcg,3,2021-05-21T14:06:03Z,"I hope Samsung representatives will see my review and fix some annoying bugs in the phone&#39;s firmware!<br><br>For 3 months of use, I have such comments or features to it<br><br>The camera and phone software is still being finalized. I think another 1 or 2 months and everything will be good! On s20 it took them six months to finish almost everything in it<br>In general, I am satisfied with the phone and recommend it for purchase.<br><br>About the camera: During the day, photos and videos are just credits, in the evening there are some smears, you need to take a photo a couple of times. It happens that in the evening or in poor lighting in the room, a 64MP camera is sharper (without smears) will take a photo than the main camera. I hope that the main camera will be fixed with updates.<br>I also noticed on my S21 that something &quot;dangles&quot; in the camera, it seems to be the camera lens. Although there is no such thing on the iPhone CE-2020 and 11<br>At first, the phone got very hot when any camera was working in it, even when the camera was just started and did not shoot anything - the phone was warming up. Now, when talking on Wi-Fi or through the mobile Internet in Telegram, after 15-20 minutes, the phone warms up to 39 degrees according to the indicators on the battery. With prolonged shooting of 4k video, the battery also warms up to 38-40 degrees<br><br>In the game PUBG-mobile, with medium or high graphics settings, FPS can be set to a maximum of 40 frames (which is not enough for a comfortable game), and 60 FPS is given only at minimum settings ... What the hell is the top processor ??? !!! And it is impossible to choose the maximum or ultra graphics settings in the game. I do not know if these are software issues of Samsung, or the developers of the PUBG game themselves put their fat &quot;bolt&quot; on the optimization of Exynos processors<br><br>Regarding the connection, I have no breaks or failures, but I noticed that the connection is a little worse than my OnePlus 6 with 845 Snapdragon. In a home or store where the OnePlus 6 showed a full scale of communication, the Samsung is one notch less.<br>I also noticed when it got warmer on the street and move around the city or in the park, then the phone is constantly warm (the sensors on the battery show the temperature in the region of 30-34 degrees), if you just sit at home then the temperature of Akum is 25-28 degrees. Probably looking for a network and warming up because of this<br><br>As for vibro, it is normal and pleasant. It is not clear just why the vibro of average quality was installed in the s21 for $ 850 (23,000 UAH), but in the s21 + and s21ultra they installed an analog of a taptik. Why is it so Samsung ?? !!!<br><br>Sometimes there are microlags, not so often, but still. And so it works smartly. It is necessary to steadily reboot the phone once every 3-5 days, it starts to dull either in the camera, or when working in the gallery<br><br>Proximity sensor on OnePlus 6 works much better than on s21 (sometimes it dulls or triggers with a delay)<br>Battery: 3880mAh real capacity, not 4000mAh<br>There is such a software glitch on the phone: when the phone is in a horizontal position (for example, in a telegram) and if you turn off the auto-rotate of the screen, then the phone does not return to portrait orientation (I will attach a screen) Sometimes it brings some inconvenience, on my OnePlus 6 this crap was not<br><br>With auto brightness and 120Hz, the phone is enough for a day, sometimes you have to recharge during the day, if you actively use the camera or play hard games + sit on the mobile Internet, then somewhere it is enough for 2-2.5 hours of screen work. So, on average, 4.5 - 5 hours of screen per day from one charge of Akum (sometimes 6 hours of screen happens, but this is rare). If you enable 60Hz screen updates, off. different enhancers such as AOD, vibration feedback at every opportunity, or triggering a fingerprint when the screen is off, the phone will last 7-8 hours of the screen<br><br>And what pisses me off about all the Samsung! So this is that when searching for a mobile number via T9 on the call keypad (by numbers), he does not look for numbers where there is Ukrainian in the name. the letter &quot;i&quot; ... PPC Even OnePlus has thought of this, but the Samsung has not been able to do it for many years. Since 2016, for sure.<br>Then it infuriates the selection of text in YouTube. What is this problem that they cannot solve even from the s20 line, that when selecting text, I then get a context menu on the FULL-SCREEN and nothing can be done afterwards, just select &quot;copy or paste&quot;, and if I wanted to select more text or less to do, then you need to start all over again (I will attach a screen)<br><br>The fingerprint scanner works worse (or not so fast) than the usual scanner in my OnePlus 6 on the back of the phone, this is especially noticeable when sometimes you need to quickly use the phone, otherwise in normal use everything is buzzing, just sometimes you need to press your finger harder against screen. But the fingerprint scanner works much better than in s10 and s20 (s20 and s10 have the same scanners)"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-21T06:19:21Z,"Im still on my galaxy s8+ and im hesitant on upgrading, im eyeing out the s10 or s10+ since they are getting cheaper with the releases of the newer phones, Im definitely not a fan of samsung getting rid of the earphone jack on their newest phones, not sure what to think of their move to get rid of sd card. But when I was browsing around the newest models, they were barely getting 3 stars if anything. So Ill wait a little bit to see how it goes."
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-05-20T23:04:37Z,Noticed every downgrade cause I&#39;m an educated customer. 1080p was a bad bad move.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-20T03:07:38Z,"Marques, I love your reviews.  Very informative but a cheaper phone is not a better one.  I left Apple back in 2018 because of their unscrupulous practice of killing older phones with IOS updates.  My Apple was constantly out of storage and memory.  I left Apple for good.  I switched to the Galaxy S9. It was way ahead of the more expensive Apple rival in every aspect. The main selling points for me (beside not having to worry about being attacked by killer updates) was the extra SD storage capability and the internal headphone plugin.  Well, it&#39;s time for a new phone so I figured I&#39;d take a look at the new S21.  Unfortunately, the big things I look for have been dropped by Samsung.  I would pay the extra $200 just to have those two features.  Therefore, no upgrade for me.  If my S9 dies I&#39;ll buy a used ones until I can&#39;t find them anymore. Samsung needs to listen to their customers and stops following Apple."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-17T22:28:06Z,"The most expensive phone that is manufactured is a 1 terabyte iPhone 12pro max, with a solid gold 24 k back, yet only costs just under $600 USD to manufacture. So justifying prices for phones and saying that a &quot;value&quot; phone thats just shy of $1,000 USD is a balancing act is a joke lmao. Phones aren&#39;t worth even close to what they&#39;re priced at. You could easily get a phone tbats top of the line, fastest processor, biggest screen with the highest refresh rate and highest resolution, with top of the line cameras and no actual camera bump AND A HEADPHONE JACK, for less than $800 easy. Even $800 is still over $300 more than manufacturing cost of the s21 ultra max 5g. The only reason companies are charging this much is because today&#39;s &quot;more educated&quot; consumers are dumber than ever and have no idea how manufacturing works or the value of an object. This phone in specific costs less than $450 to manufacture. Meaning that anything over $450 is profit that will pay for the device, payroll, overhead, etc. And its funny that the s21, compared to the s21 ultra max 5g, is only about $150 in price difference, but you&#39;re gonna be charged over $400 in difference for the &quot;bigger&quot; one."
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-05-17T17:45:34Z,My S7 screen cracked today. Watched some videos and new phones and decided I&#39;m gonna just change the screen. Nothing better than s7 yet.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-17T17:12:28Z,I didn&#39;t like the fact that there was NO plug to charge the phone. I called Samsung to voice that complaint. And NO way to plug in earbuds. They said because everything is now wireless. üòî

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-15T12:30:01Z,"I ordered this phone yesterday. Dont get me wrong, I&#39;m excited. But phones have definitely taken some steps back. I havent replaced my smartphone in 5 years and the market hasnt changed much. Verizon store is selling a bunch of brick phones. You know, the over 10 year old tired design. And the fact that I need an adapter to use headphones is pretty lame. But of all the brick phones on the market right now, this was the most interesting. I would have gone for the lg wing if it weren&#39;t for lg going out of business."

I didn&#39;t even notice the resolution drop until the specs mentioned it. I prefer the durability of plastic back to the glass, although it does lose the more premium look and feel. All in all it feels like a sidegrade with some quality of life improvements, but it runs nice and smooth."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-12T06:10:02Z,Is it worth the extra money to upgrade from the S21 to the S21 Ultra for the resolution alone?

Honestly, I get more excitement out of buying a new phone case these days. I&#39;m still on an s10e.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-02T21:34:05Z,"After the years of over priced mobile, of course, Samsung feel the competition from China,, they forced to follow the steps, reduce the price,"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-02T21:00:15Z,Am I the only one who just want a camera that can shoot an image or a video and don&#39;t care about more from it
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-02T03:50:27Z,Stereo sound?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-02T03:39:12Z,How many android update S21 has
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-02T00:05:44Z,"i find it funny that the things listwd that phone users care about is what i phone users look for.  <br><br>i&#39;m more interested in functionality, and expandable memory. <br>i&#39;m sad they got rid of the sd card slot tray. and i do miss the bixby button and the curved edges. but ii&#39;s slowly growing on me.  slowly &gt;.&gt;"
dhAmMXCBIcg,4,2021-05-01T17:29:15Z,Guess I&#39;ll wait until they come to their senses and bring expandable storage back on the next one
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-05-01T15:12:20Z,"the only act of balance samsung did is what kind of profit percentage they make; is it 100% is it 150% or so on. Let&#39;s be real, not including a charger is a cost saving move at best, even if they cut the price, as the price should&#39;ve come down anyway thanks to not including external 5G chip and using still selling those damned exynos chips and charging the same price as the superior SD variant.<br><br>The only thing I liked about this gen samsung smartphone is that they FINALLY ditched the curved screen. It was never a good idea anyway, and they held on to that for years is kind of amazing. Oh, and the &quot;glastic&quot; back panel feels good to the touch. And that&#39;s about it. It&#39;s not much of a change, and outside of US, still disappointing as always. Samsung, let me be real, LSI sucks. Disband it and just buy SD chips internationally. it&#39;ll save you R&amp;D cost, and reduce the whole complexity of your business."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-30T22:39:25Z,"Samsung camera software, a total mess, a lot of inconsistency, noise at low iso and exposure, weak processing to remove noise. They are behind Apple, Huawei, Google at least 3 years, before p20 pro era. Try s21 with pixel camera app in low/medium light condition, or indoor, you will be blown away, it&#39;s like having another sensor. Instead of pushing MS crap on their phones(onedrive, office and others), they should make a partnership with Google to improve their camera software. If you are trying for several years in a row to improve you camera software, processing, and you are not able to do it, then ask for help(from Google)."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-30T17:35:56Z,i want to buy a new phone but i dont know which one to get someone recommanded me de oppo find x3 neo but i was thinking about galaxy s21 if someone can help me i would appreciatie it

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-29T07:34:04Z,Text on my old Pixel 2 XL looks sharper than on the S21. Must be because of the higher ppi.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-29T03:48:17Z,I wish it would&#39;ve come out a little earlier because I could&#39;ve gotten it
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-28T17:49:15Z,So the question is should i buy this phone?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-28T17:32:32Z,Thank God T Mobile sending me this phone for good price

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-26T03:36:43Z,Nice shirt !
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-25T21:43:06Z,Do not buy any samsung without aux jack. The adapters they provide are not working and you wont be able to use headphones. I am so dissapointed with S20 FE.
dhAmMXCBIcg,3,2021-04-25T20:51:31Z,"Thank you for the review! I have the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and I might upgrade. The only thing I don&#39;t like is that the cameras on these phones have only 12 megapixels, where is at one point they were making them 14. If they could do it before, I don&#39;t know why they can&#39;t do it again, especially for the price that they charge."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-24T19:21:50Z,is oneplus 8t more worth it to buy tho?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-24T17:37:44Z,Samsung should bring back the mocro SD card the headphone jack and the power breaker too but the phone colour look so good hope in 2022 samsung bring back all these.

They can turn on Airplane Mode on my phone which is dangerous because my phone can be stolen and if the thief know this, it will cause &quot;find my phone/find my device&quot; to become less effective in our attempt to save our phone.<br>I also have video recording of me trying to use different voice tone to try turning on Airplane mode on my phone."

I still can&#39;t hear when I have a phone call cause no matter what I do the phone ring tone volume is always nothing. It&#39;s still buggy as hell...like closing my map over and over because it wants to put the phone ahead of it...etc etc. Fix android and I&#39;ll upgrade.

Samsung needs a better battery for the s21 WARNIING DONT GET IT... if ur coming from an s10+ just keep it and wait for samsung to release a better and fully capable 5g phone

dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-04-12T18:09:31Z,"I got the S21+ through Samsung&#39;s trade in program. I have to say I miss the MST since some of the vending machines at work don&#39;t have NFC, but eh, everything else does. Everything else is good.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-11T07:38:26Z,One tip would be is dont buy this Samsung model if you live in Europe as it has <br>an inferior CPU  compaired to the ones that ship to the USA. If you <br>really need one then ship one from the USA.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-10T22:54:14Z,Thete&#39;s also no jack for earphones . I like listen to Spotify when I&#39;m outside.I think the only I can do is to buy a bluetooth headset but this are more expensive.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-10T08:55:24Z,Anyone bought this phone? Is it worth the price? Looking to upgrade from a Asus Zenfone 5
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-10T08:50:14Z,"S21 is not more value. Theyve reduced all the features, especially chargers and SD cards. Shit company, I used to be a Samsung fan but I&#39;m switching like many others. They&#39;re acting like they&#39;ve dropped the price due to the features when it was artificially inflated anyways.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-06T10:08:07Z,I really want one better phone like samsung S or Note. Rn i have A71
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-06T09:35:45Z,"Hey Marques, please do review videos on the Samsung A series too! Please! TIA"
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-04-05T15:32:46Z,"Samsung needs to get their shit together and build in every phone either the Exynos or Qualcomm chip and not dependent on the region. If they use two different chips, they need to make two different models."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-05T14:35:07Z,"I have the smallest s21 and the battery life is bad, i mean reeeeal baadd... and samsung gave me the galaxy active 2 fo free. My S8 was better i promise"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-05T07:49:15Z,I wonder if I can buy a protective cover for the Samsung S21.
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-04-05T06:57:13Z,"My beloved S10+ 5G cracked in my pocket so I went out and picked up an S21+ without doing ANY research on Samsung phones since I got my S10+ <br>I didn&#39;t watch a single video on the S21. Well it&#39;s been 2 days and I noticed every single missing feature over the S10+. I&#39;m kind of blown away by it.<br>I feel regret every time I pick the phone up. The only redeeming quality to me is the camera and 120hz. Everything else about the S10+ 5G is better to me. <br>Just really bummed and ashamed of myself. because now I&#39;m stuck with it for 2 years. I will most definitely be ditching Samsung after this. And I&#39;ve had ever Galaxy S phone since the S3. <br>Sorry, just needed to let that out."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-05T06:37:43Z,"A plastic back, no micro SD, no variable aperture (I know, since s20), what do they think we are, Apple users? I will continue to take good care of my s9 plus until Samsung decides to create something good again."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-04-04T19:42:45Z,"The problem is that overall the S21 is a downgrade from S20 . The biggest problem is the Display . I know the S20 only had 60hz on 1440p and 120hz on 1080 , but at least you could choose . On you S20 if you whant higher refresh rate for gaming you can go for 1080 120hz , but if you whant to look at a quality display you can change it to 1440p 60hz .  On S21 they took that away and that is a big problem . It is the first time in S-series History when a new S-series has lower features compare to the old one .  Let s say i would understand that if the price of S21 would be cheaper , but is even more expensive than S20 , so yes that is problem .  Who care s that S20 was more expensive when was relesead if now S20 has better features and better price. I don t get why on earh would someone woud pay that kind of money for S21?"

I have been a galaxy owner for over eight years and love them until this phone everything else was actually fine but the volume was a huge issue for me I could not get it loud enough and when I was at the gym and I have my earphones on I could hear everyone and it just I was so annoying and they couldn‚Äôt get it loud enough they couldn‚Äôt fix the problem so I had to go to the Darkside and get an iPhone. Everything else about the phone was all right but the volume is an issue hopeless it review help someone take care friends

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-03-27T17:02:55Z,"Am I the only one who cares about the expandable storage? I used to be an iphone user, i owned from the Iphone 2, 4, and 5 until the last one broke and I was so pissed since i didn&#39;t have a warranty. After that I bought an extremely cheap galaxy s3 just because the camera was broken , then I fixed it. Since then I fell in love with those features that the Iphone lacked. With the years I feel like the newer Samsung phones are becoming more like an iphone. I had my Note 9 for 3 years with no intention of switching to a new phone whoever the motherboard got fried, and I had to buy a new phone, I opted for an s20 instead of the s21. Still... I am missing the headphone jack in my new s20."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-03-25T17:00:44Z,"Trust me, the S21 Plus is the GO-TO!!!. People say there&#39;s no difference...but there is!. I owned all 3 of the S21 models. <br>It feels much more premium and sturdy than the S21, but not as heavy, bulky, and awkward looking as the S21 Ultra. If you&#39;re worried about missing out on the 120hz QHD display on the Ultra, from the 120hz FHD on the S21 Plus....don&#39;t be. There is practically no noticeable difference, unless you are part of the 0.00000001% of the population who can see a pixel with the naked eye. <br>The S21 Plus retains the thinness of the S21, but having a wider, larger display makes it feel thinner, even making the camera bump feel very small. The S21 Plus feels significantly more premium than the S21, and it almost looks as if the screen quality is better than the S21. Not to mention the screen is completely flat, and stretched out to each corner, giving the phone a nice, slab/boxy feeling to it, but still feeling thin. <br>The S21 Ultra, is far too large, very heavy, very thick, and very awkward looking with the &quot;very slightly&quot; curved display, but rounded corners and thick sides....not to mention...the weight! It hurts your arms to hold. <br>there&#39;s a reason the S21+ has been the hardest to find in stock...and in my opinion it is definitely the best kept secret of the 3."

The only reason I‚Äôve done it was that I can‚Äôt stand those really ugly icons (for messages, clock, calendar...). They look very unprofessional, like they‚Äôre been made by kindergarten kids, also using ugly colours. It‚Äôs only me or only Samsung not seeing that small thing that ruins the UI look?

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-03-23T13:18:52Z,"Its not just the conscience decision to offer more value, but its also because s20 did so absolutely poorly because it was so expensive when it came out. Even the base s20 was over a grand out of the gate and plummeted as the months went by especially in the used market. Now s20 a year later and the s21 this year are both worth it."

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-03-20T23:38:47Z,Great video. Both the information and........i think cinematography is the word I want! It was very visually appealing
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-03-20T23:11:10Z,Only issue is the lack of expandable storage. Personally I think it&#39;s BS that &quot;it&#39;s only $50 more&quot;. I&#39;ve got sd cards already that I can use in multiple places that won&#39;t charge me an extra $50 dollars and that would give me way more than 256 total storage.
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-03-20T22:23:02Z,I&#39;m trying to upgrade my phone to this and yes a diva still has the Samsung J7 I know everybody probably laughing at me!

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-03-20T20:36:18Z,"you missed one important thing: the phone already has a glass protector which makes it feel less qualitative (no idea of you can take it off). You should compare it with the screen of huawei p20 pro, you ll be surprised. the difference was so big that i even returned the S21."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-03-17T02:41:32Z,Is it worth upgrading to from the S20?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-03-16T18:03:55Z,My Samsung Galaxy S8 only has a 5.8 screen I just can&#39;t part with it yet it&#39;s been a great phone not that I can&#39;t upgrade
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-03-16T08:16:09Z,"Broke my S10+, was thinking about getting S21+ instead but... S21+ has no noticeable difference in cameras, and a 120Hz screen simply doesn&#39;t cover a 300$ difference in price between S10+ and S21+.<br><br>S10+ (600$) is much cheaper, it has almost the same cameras, it has a bigger resolution screen, it has 3.5mm jack, it has SD-card slot, it lasts longer.<br>S21+ (900$) has a 120Hz screen, the body feels better to me. And it has 5G support, but who cares. And that&#39;s it.<br><br>I think Samsung marketers just failed with S21/S21+... <br><br>Going to buy S10+ ... again. Haha."
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-03-16T05:18:44Z,I&#39;m watching this on S10. Omg the batteries on phones nowadays are so bad. :/

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-03-15T23:47:11Z,Does any1 else see a micro chip through the glass when its in the light or sun? its a little microchip box behind the glass of my new s21 5g about centered 2 inches from the bottom of the phone probablly .5 inches squared. ? Its really annoying now that I noticed it. Has to be a defect but just asking while I sort it out since its been 3 weeks out of ATT 2 week return.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-03-07T20:42:36Z,"Personally, I&#39;m starting to think a plastic back is better. Firstly, lowers the price of the phone. Secondly, you don&#39;t notice it nowadays, especially if you have a case. Thirdly, you&#39;ll never have to pay so much for a back glass repair ever again! It&#39;s a win-win-win!"
dhAmMXCBIcg,213,2021-03-07T12:47:27Z,"Well I always have a phone case on my phone and everyone rocks on phone case, so what&#39;s the point of spending the extra 200 dollars for glass you only feel when you first unbox it."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-28T12:24:35Z,S21 ultra is good but the only reason why Samsung can getaway with charging high price for it is because xiaomi is not mainstream in the US yet

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-28T09:46:31Z,I dropped my s10 and called my insurance and filed for it. But at the time I couldn‚Äôt afford the deductible for it. When I finally called back they said because of how long I waited I lost my claim. I checked around and with Samsung website and got a price of 280 something. When I called Samsung I explained to them that because of my plant shutting down certain days due to covid I didn‚Äôt have the money then and now that my plant is back open pretty much all the time I do and Samsung because of that offered me over 60% discount to bring it to the same price my insurance wanted for a deductible. Which is pretty cool I am definitely sticking to Samsung now. I didn‚Äôt even have to ask the lady on the phone offered and said they like to take care of their customers regardless of a pandemic or not.

The battery on highest settings got 9 hours and 27 minutes of screen on time. I like the plastic back because I got a two year old and it still has wireless charging. It&#39;s SUPER light. I got it for 400 switching to xfinity mobile. I am INCREDIBLY happy and recommend this to anyone. I don&#39;t miss carrying a brick! And if someone needs a longer battery you can buy a battery case and you can have your phone be light when your home and near a charger or a heavier battery case when your out.

The Exynos variant perform worse and/or have worse battery life and make worse pictures due to the SoC. For the S21 it&#39;s simply up 20 % less performance when stress testing it and pictures are worse with the Exynos version but the battery life is on par.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-14T18:28:22Z,I notice that all reviewers seem to skip over networking...including you. Why is the U.S. model always only single sim and overseas gets dual sim? Even iphone has had dual sim for a couple years now. Why are the LTE and 5G bands so hampered? Does nobody ever travel outside the U.S. ? iphone has every band to take their device anywhere and VoLTE works. Even Google added most of the LTE and 5G bands for world wide use.. Not Samsung but hey let&#39;s charge about a $1000 for a device good for only your region.. Oh and we&#39;ll not honor any warranty unless in your region. How about we start calling out these companies on this....

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-14T13:06:06Z,Thank you so much for the honest review I was a little worried because I heard some things weren&#39;t there but from what you have said in this review that sounds like this is going to be the phone to get. I currently have an S8+ and even though the screen is a little bit smaller and won&#39;t have 1440p it looks like it is going to be a massive upgrade from the S8+ up to the S21. My S8+ is quad core with 4gb ram the S21 has octo core with 8gb of ram so if everything works properly that&#39;s double what I currently have that should awesome. And the fact it&#39;s so much cheaper than the rest of the market and it&#39;s brand new(As in it was released in 2021) and my S8+ was released in 2017. I think this is going to be a massive upgrade for me so thanks again for the Honest review. I was looking to get a Galaxy A series from 2018/2019 but now I&#39;m pretty sure that I&#39;ll definitely check out this instead thanks again üòÄüòÄ.

dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-13T06:01:28Z,Okay...a couple of things. First) I still have a SD 865 phone with 8gb of RAM. It&#39;s still flying. I feel this way since the SD 845. I think we&#39;ve reached a point where phones are way OP for what we do (for most). Second) can I notice the difference between 2k and 1080p? Yes. But in a phone screen I really have to look. So for these savings I can deal with it. The plastic back. In store at least it feels like glass minus the cold feel without touching it for a while. Is that a serious feature? Not at all. I think this is a solid phone that should get it right for a lot of people.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-09T02:49:31Z,"S21 just plain sucks when compared with iPhone 12 at any level no matter how hard these youtubers will try to find something good about S21. I owe both at the same time, 12 Pro - work, S21 Ultra - personal. I am a dedicated Android geek, but to say that S21 is in any way better (from a consumer perspective) just to justify its price tag vs its competition when there is nothing good that would be like Republicans supporting Trump: supporting the brand at any cost.<br>In S21 - face recognition sucks (could not get it to work properly in dark rooms), finger print sucks (in the middle of the screen keeps asking me to press harder...ha)... design and quality? Just look at S21...then look at iPhone 12...you tell me which one sucks there too?...Or you can just take Galaxy S6 and you can right away notice the quality drop in S21... Maybe if the price tag would be at half I could understand.<br>Whoever designed S21 and approved it for sell should be fired.<br>Sorry...I wish I could say something good about S21 but it disappointed me terribly"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-07T02:47:12Z,"honestly I am very angry that Samsung went away from the reasons that I loved it, I might as well get a Iphone at this point (not a bad phone) but I am looking for more alternative phones, sad day for Samsung"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-07T02:44:24Z,Yo what phones have MST now?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-07T00:14:10Z,"no matter how much gigs they put on their phone, if can&#39;t input my micro sd card in there... noway am going to buy it"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-07T00:12:52Z,I wish they would&#39;ve kept the LPDDR5 ram instead of reserving it for the s21 ultra that is a downgrade.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T20:54:23Z,Looking at the comments I know I was not the only one who watched that intro more than once! MKBHD - The YouTube Tech G.O.A.T
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T20:47:54Z,Better low light photos compared to ultra due do less pixels in camera?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T20:19:41Z,"Can the s21 cast to tv without using Chromecast or a router, i.e. just using WiFi data? I don&#39;t have a router, just use my unlimited data on T-Mobile. I&#39;m cheap, just use my data for internet."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T20:16:18Z,We need the Exynos vs Snapdragon.Comparison.Please MKBHD.Please
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T19:58:46Z,how is 5-6h screen on time no worry battery? :))
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T19:19:58Z,I got a S20 and it the best phone way better then iPhone
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T19:02:05Z,"I want to step back from Apple to Samsung or OnePlus. I have right now an iPhone X, is this a good option to buy, or should I wait on the OnePlus 9?"

dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-06T18:54:32Z,With out the headphone jack and expandable memory it&#39;s just an expensive OnePlus phone. My s10 Plus is my last Galaxy flagship phone.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T18:53:49Z,"Note 3 at launch, s7 at launch, s10e at launch. S7 was the sweet spot on size for me"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T18:39:48Z,-its look cheap‚Ä¶. Look like a mid ranger phone with that single flash outside the camera bump
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T18:31:30Z,"Funny, you kept on mentioning price but I don‚Äôt think you mentioned how much it was. You said they dropped the price and all sorts of other stuff though"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T16:19:51Z,Idk if people are more educated than ever. They think what the news and it&#39;s various propaganda mediums says is reality. Blind leading the blind.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T15:06:37Z,Best portrait mode.... Lol this is why I don&#39;t take this guy seriously...
dhAmMXCBIcg,4,2021-02-06T14:53:02Z,The camera looks like the terminators eye which I kinda like

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T10:03:01Z,Dude. Your wide video is overlapping my s10 camera bruh..... smh .....
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T10:00:12Z,Mobile phone tech is dead. Just get a phone and move on. An older version should be good. Boring at best!!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T09:34:11Z,yeaaaa it costs 1000 $ here for the standard S21 and its Exynos so Samsung can shove it - ... -
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T09:26:18Z,S21 is the most balanced phone in smartphone history
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T08:52:01Z,The review is awesome as always and nice beard though!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T08:40:58Z,bro i use samsung pay so often and i just bought the s21....

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T06:36:53Z,Why they are not giving Snapdragon in all regions
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T06:31:58Z,I think they killed MST because magnetic card readers will soon be a thing of the past as the standard has moved to chip readers and encrypted contactless payment.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T05:57:51Z,I bought this  today and I must say it&#39;s amazing the only downside is it doesn&#39;t have an original headphone plug in.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T05:51:32Z,What is name of the song which is played in intro
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T05:29:04Z,Feel so poor üò≠
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T04:57:51Z,So like.. samsung just forgot about its e series? Like s10e family is gone?
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-06T04:56:19Z,The composition of this video is truly mind blowing and inspiring

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T04:30:56Z,Ok i didn&#39;t notice anything

dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-06T03:22:24Z,"No SD slot is an absolute killer IMO.  Out of 128GB, there is really only about 90GB left after Android OS and bloatware.  That doesn&#39;t go very far when shooting 4K or 8K.  Anyone who plans on using the camera much should consider the 256GB option.  Hopefully Samsung will reconsider the SD on the S22 - otherwise a lot of us will be saying goodbye."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T03:22:13Z,I just can&#39;t get behind the camera panel
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T03:09:47Z,There are lots of stuff missing but will the public notice? - well now they will because you have pointed out CLEARLY...... :|

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T01:03:33Z,The fact that 6.2‚Äù is considered small now shows me how fast smartphones are progressing.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T00:59:56Z,why do my pictures on the s21 look like sh*t and the pics in his video look good??????
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T00:49:11Z,"Damn Marques. We aren&#39;t all like you. To most of the demographic that watches this video, 6.2 inches is good sized, not a little small...<br><br><br>I mean, have you seen the size of your hands?"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T00:22:08Z,weird video edition. or at least different....
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-06T00:12:31Z,it will be interesting to see comparisons between LG V 60 and S 21 Ultra
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-06T00:11:25Z,Best review you ever made.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T23:57:24Z,Portrait mode!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T23:36:07Z,"I have a lg g8, love everything about it, saw the Samsung S21 liked it too, but not really sure yet, because I miss the headphone jack, to plug in my aux port in my car, since my Subaru doesn&#39;t have Bluetooth stereo, and price could be cheaper, like $700 for the cheaper s21, I&#39;m done paying for my lg g8 in May of 2021, I&#39;m going either upgrade to Samsung 21 or one plus 9, both phones have better updates than my lg g8, whatever phone I upgrade to by May, I&#39;m still keeping my lg g8"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T23:11:19Z,No expandable storage on the entire lineup does it for me. Shopping a new manufacturer and I&#39;ve have Samsung notes since the note 3
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T23:00:02Z,"It&#39;s not just plastic back and lower screen resolution, the regular S21 also has the average vibration motor instead of the haptic one that S21+ and Ultra have."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T22:43:04Z,Brother i dont know how much they pay u for reviews but i can tell u something for sure. This S21 its a pure trash  overpriced phone. It has 1080x2400 resolution and on purpose they removed the option in the menu from S20 where u can change from 1080x2400 to 3200x1440. The phone cannot play videos in youtube more than 1080p can u imagine ? You are youtuber when was the last time u watched video on 1080p lol? Samsung S6 has 1440 x 2560 and CAN play 1440p in youtube .. imagine S21 cannot. I asked samsung support &#39;&#39;experts&#39;&#39; the guy has no idea what im talking about telling me i dont know where to click in youtube to change the quality they also didnt know this phone is terrible.  I cannot believe i cant click higher quality than 1080p in youtube with this phone for 900 euro it has the specs of A version which are 400 euro and less. Who is watching videos at 1080p really ? Im sending this phone back really i cant believe Samsung can go so dawn. S6 edge cost 50 euro second hand imagine  and has better screen ü§£ü§£ü§£
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-05T22:35:01Z,"Can anyone tell me the name of that intro song? I&#39;ve listened to it so many times, it&#39;s stuck in my head"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T22:28:14Z,But WHAT about this phone is so much better than s10+? ANYONE can read spec sheets all day long... is this phone ANY better than what we see everyday?

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T19:25:45Z,He keeps saying calculus for calculations. I think the college math trauma is back?

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T18:45:16Z,but still the old problem: Exynos Processor. They are slower and the need more battery

dhAmMXCBIcg,3,2021-02-05T18:35:51Z,Lol that intro was smother then Howard stark at the playboy mansion
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T18:20:15Z,1300 euros is not cheap
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T18:13:18Z,Samsung portrait mode will NEVER be better than the iPhone
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T17:58:51Z,I do not like at all the dropped expandable storage...I do not want to depend on my phone to collect my data or cloud services...this is stupid.... It wouldn&#39;t have cost them that much to keep that in... I&#39;m moving on to a phone that can S10 is the first and last of samsung for me. I&#39;m also an audio guy and I enjoy my plug in headphone jack. NO Bluetooth damn it....leave the headphone jack alone
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T17:51:24Z,"Vehemently disagree about people &quot;not noticing&quot; the sacrifices. The display is fine, but clearly you haven&#39;t watched many reviews/comments on reviews about the plastic on this phone. The back is terrible. Looks and feels extremely cheap compared to the Plus and Ultra. Ridiculous that there&#39;s no premium compact flagship from Samsung anymore. It&#39;s kinda crazy considering how many phones Samsung makes that there is no longer a single premium compact model. My Phantom White S21 feels like a smaller S20 FE. If you want a premium compact Android flagship, either get last year&#39;s S20 or the Xperia 5ii."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T17:50:53Z,Bruh Samsung really did copy apple for the alternate home button by dragging up the stick or line to refresh apps or close or use to come to home screen
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T17:47:56Z,Belive it or not ....<br>i replayed the intro like 10 times like some kinda addict lol..<br>Sick intro Marques

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T17:14:24Z,I think they lost their way w the design language. They went from making gorgeous phones to something just hideous

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T16:57:45Z,So Samsung gets to decide whether we&#39;ll notice or not?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T16:56:16Z,I remember the shitstorm when OnePlus came with 1080p display on it&#39;s latest phone at that time and all reviewers were complaining. After a couple of years Samsung flagship regressed to 1080p and &quot;no one will notice&quot;. Interesting times

The ultra is just too big and with a case, considerably heavier. Watching you tube on my s10+, the actual increase in video size on the s21U is barely noticeable unless you zoom in to the fit the screen, but then you miss cropped content. And you tube constantly defaults to 1080p so will I really notice the drop in resolution. The 100x zoom is OK but a gimmick i feel, likewise the Marco shots are incredible but how often will it be used? Anyone else has any thoughts?"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T09:33:34Z,"Reviewers always penalise for phones that use plastic. But I honestly prefer plastic over glass. It&#39;s more durable, more forgiving, cheaper and high quality plastics can have a premium feel to them too. So long as it&#39;s of  a high quality I&#39;ll have no issue with it. One drop in the right place with a glass case and boom your phone is toast. Plastic however is the boss when it comes to durability. Look at the old Nokias as proof."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-05T04:04:17Z,"honestly the only thing i found annoying about this phone is that when you use the &quot;keep open&quot; feature for an app, where the app would stay open and keep using part of the ram so that it starts up instantly. you can only keep one app open all the time..... i thought the older s phones (the s20 i believe) and the note 10 and 20 could keep more than one app open. Hopefully they&#39;ll let you keep more apps open once they start to put more ram in their phones."

That phone was so bomb that I am actually missing it. It is still really good today. But trade it in because the sprint trade in makes S9+ worth 800 and the total im paying for is $400 for the s21 Ultra. Like they know we will invest the $400 because their phones are promising good, and good for years. Ultra is noticeably good. But S9 or any later flagship can do almost as good. Some people still like the headphone jack, fingerprint in the back and what not.  That&#39;s how good their phones are, cuz you know 400 is worth the investment, especially during the pandemic! üòâ"

In my country costs the same as much as an iPhone 12, and apple kinda wins over this, to be honest not to mention Samsung&#39;s shitty politics over region marketing, like we get different specs with Exynos which drains the battery so bad and heat the phone way too much.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T19:59:08Z,"In recent years, Samsung phones have been disappointing. They don&#39;t offer significantly better values when compared to Apple anymore. The year over year improvements aren&#39;t significant yet the price keeps climbing. There was a time when Galaxy S mean premium or flagship. But Samsung follows Apple&#39;s footstep when they replace the iPhone XR with Iphone 11,  and now they make the S21 an expensive budget phone. It&#39;s 50% more expensive the S20FE, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s 50% more value. Even budget phones from Chinese brands with half the price have FHD+ 120Hz display, and a Galaxy S21 has a FHD display??? Specs and performance asides, that&#39;s disrespecting customers. I&#39;m using a Samsung Galaxy S7 Tablet, but I can&#39;t see myself buying a Samsung Galaxy S phone. The company that sells screen to other brands can&#39;t put the best screen on their supposedly flagship line up? What a joke! Perhaps people in the North America and EU will choose this since they are the only options available, money isn&#39;t a big problem, and Chinese phones aren&#39;t available. In more budget conscious markets, $750+ is flagship price, I don&#39;t see this phone fares well against Chinese competition like Xiaomi, Oppo, Oneplus. Let&#39;s be real, Samsung slightly lowers the starting prices this year because they have no choice. The SoC (SD888, Ex2100) can&#39;t match the performance of A14 Bionic, hell, I&#39;m not even sure if they can definitively beat the A13, LOL. Android software still can&#39;t match the optimization of iOS. I&#39;ve always complained that iPhones are overpriced (which I still think $1000 smartphones are ridiculous) while Android phones offers better specs and better performance. The fact is that they don&#39;t. And Samsung pricing doesn&#39;t help the &quot;better value offering&quot; argument either."

With this in mind people still have to pay 800$ for a sub-par screen just cause they &#39;won&#39;t notice&#39; it&#39;s a bad deal, just like the support.

Is the screen brighter yes, but I usually ha e set to the lowest. Are the colors better the screen? I&#39;d say it&#39;s 25% better to my eyes. One week in using it and the screen looks no different from my s8 and that&#39;s probably because my eyes got use to the ultra. Are the pictures crisper? Sort of and the pictures look better on my ultras screen or any s20, fold or iphone 11-12. Are the cameras good? Sure, but I&#39;m no photographer and no influencer so the extra cameras are bust. I honestly do t notice the difference between my s8 and ultra. The refresh rate? It looked good at first, and now after a week of use I can&#39;t tell the difference anymore. I&#39;d say over all the phone is meh."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T15:54:03Z,Have you ever dropped any of the phones you reviewed during the &#39;stairs shot&#39;?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T15:53:59Z,I think the camera takes better videos
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T15:44:18Z,Intro is sick ü§ëü§ë
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-04T15:38:05Z,Just me or is his body language exaggerated today?üòÇ
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T15:34:21Z,Should I buy s21 or s20+?
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-04T15:32:43Z,That intro itself deserves a like
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T15:28:20Z,Why would he even recommend Samsung to use Snapdragon 765g series in the Galaxy S lineup? <br>Meanwhile most part of the world is using the Shitty Exynos chip that is not even on par with the Snapdragon 888. <br>Is he promoting Samsung by saying this?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T15:21:17Z,Yeah the performance would have been noticeable with a 765G man what are you talking about...
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T15:16:40Z,"So cool how they made the phone cheaper in lots of ways, but where I live the phone has got LITERALY 120% EXPANSIVE compared to the Galaxy 20 :DDDD"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T15:11:39Z,"Hello Sir, I just don&#39;t know why the S21 still starts at 69,990 Rupees in India, which is roughly 960 US Dollars."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T15:07:19Z,Damn mkbhd took mr beast&#39;s advice
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T15:04:20Z,I&#39;m not paying for a samsung that is more like an iPhone. The only reason I got the S20 vs 1plus is the micro sd card slot. No micro sd...I&#39;m out. Great vids tho MKBHD!  Keep it up.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T14:59:57Z,"No SD card??? Nope, you can fock off Samsung"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T14:56:16Z,Can we just ask why the bezels aren&#39;t the same size on all sides? It&#39;s been years and this one detail drives me mad.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T14:52:00Z,I&#39;ll be watching this after class.
dhAmMXCBIcg,3,2021-02-04T14:51:19Z,A performance comparison video between the Snapdragon and the Exynos chipset of this line would be very interesting Marques
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T14:48:23Z,This still costs 20% more than Oneplus 8 Pro in India !!

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T14:42:40Z,This phone offers less in the box but for some reason still costs more than the s20 counterpart in my country ffs
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T14:41:15Z,"Nah, I love my 4k at 60hz."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T14:33:26Z,"The regular s21 and plus model on a technical level don&#39;t need laser autofocus as you probably already know(but some Newby smart phone people may not) that those models have dual pixel autofocus on their main sensor instead of what I call phaser, phase detection and laser. If you ask me Though, dual pixel still reigns Supreme esp for lower light autofocus and video recording. (coming from a 21 ultra user)"
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-04T14:33:13Z,"The intro is a work of art. Good Job. As for the S21, I&#39;m disappointed that Samsung decided to remove MST and expandability. Those two features are extremely important to me."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T14:33:11Z,What about the Galaxy S21 plus ?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T14:32:15Z,"the drawback is the ppi, from 500+ to slightly below 400 on S21+<br>changing from s8 to s21+<br>at first did not notice it<br>but when browsing fb, the video/picture is slightly blur, same goes to reading pdf<br>samsung should make 450 ppi as std"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T14:29:12Z,44hz min VRR is not a small change. That could turn out to be a pretty big deal

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T14:07:38Z,Intro is inspired by passive radiator XD
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T14:03:56Z,Wait.. don&#39;t u need 64MP for 8k? 8k x 8k?

dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-04T13:58:31Z,I‚Äôm Korean and I was surprised...because many of foreigners love Samsung..<br>Samsung is surely best seller in Korea<br>but many Koreans think Samsung can never beat Apple because of its design (not looking pretty)
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T13:55:44Z,Can‚Äôt wait for S21 Fan Edition

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T13:22:42Z,upgrading from s9 is a big diffrence other than the screen resolution.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T13:00:26Z,Just had a question that s21 ultra  camera has a small focus length as it has 108MP camera so if we are taking close shots some part will be blured. So regular s21 and s21+ as a 12MP lenses still we have that problem or not ???
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T13:00:10Z,samsung should just stop making exynos cpu
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T12:56:17Z,This with the cameras is an exaggeration. Buy a fucking camera
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T12:51:23Z,"Some people make too much money and seem disconnected from other&#39;s reality... Being like that, you should just review the technical aspects of phones and stop talking rubbish about prices, especially as you don&#39;t feel concerned in the least."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T10:20:06Z,Technically s21 or any s21 veriant is not the fastest android even with sd888.. Its iqoo 7..you can see that in benchmarks even s21 ultra scored only under 700k where as iqoo 7 scored above 700k..even in 3d benchmarking iqoo 7 scored better than even s21 ultraü§£..so s21 ultra or s21 or plus is only good in case of camera.. If You want perfomance you should go for vivo new sd888 smartphone or iqoo 7 smartphone because it perfomance better..

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T10:14:58Z,The S10 has the best and balanced design of all Samsung galaxy smartphones ever.
dhAmMXCBIcg,5,2021-02-04T10:10:05Z,"Been using S21 since it came out. The only thing I noticed, I really miss more contrast in videos and display. I switched to S21 from S8 which is 4 years old and Youtube videos look so much colourful on S8. S21 seems a little washed out. Also, the enhancing option for apps like YT is actually making them look brighter which I don&#39;t like, so I turned it off."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T10:08:08Z,"Yeah the intro was cool, but how‚Äôd you do the floating phone thing at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhAmMXCBIcg&amp;t=125"">2:05</a>"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T10:03:28Z,"Im really disappointed. Why plastic backs? All budget phones have a glass back. Why tri wing screws inside the phone? Why way worse camera then last year? They recently locked components on the A51, that makes at least me very nervous of buying this phone, it can be locked any second. And most importantly WHY 1080P? my s6 edge has 1440p AND NOT THIS?"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T10:00:39Z,Samsung can know how many customer used phone mostly on QHD OR FHD n from that they made this change
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T09:58:45Z,"Dude are you joking!!?<br>Portrait mode on my Samsung galaxy s10 is horrible ,useless, i dont even use it i use gcam only for portraits"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T09:55:31Z,The 1080p didn&#39;t matter last year because what matters is the panels subpixel arrangement which is noticable for those of us with keen eyes. You can get used to it but the subpixel arrangement is noticable with white on black text.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T09:54:25Z,The intro is so good!

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T09:46:18Z,sad thing is alot of places still dont do nfc cuz they think they gotta pay a apple pay fee. which i dont think u do. its really annoying. so not having tht just work all option sucks
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T09:44:40Z,The only mistake they made was offering the 256gb model in gray only. Even someone like me who wants everything as close to matte black as possible is really digging the purple.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-04T09:42:26Z,"Probably the autofocus is better than the ultra, my guess"

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-04T09:06:14Z,about the MST: here it‚Äôs hard to find a register that doesn‚Äôt support NFC so I guess it‚Äôs just not a function that is super necessary anymore.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T23:14:44Z,"The significant change I do notice is the missing SD card slot and the extra storage it offers. Google Photos are no longer unlimited and free, OneDrive replaced Samsung Cloud which is also shrinking and getting more expensive, meanwhile SD card prices are going down. Shooting 4K videos quickly eat up all the storage without installing apps that are also getting bigger, also downloading and watching content, say from YouTube in 4K is not an option for the same reasons, which is weird considering the S21 is meant to be a true multimedia phone capable of handling 4K videos. Lets not go into the &quot;why not storing stuff on your PC&quot; and the &quot;you can attach extra storage via USB&quot; topics. I don&#39;t carry my desktop PC with me to access my stuff is the answer for the first issue. For the second‚Ä¶ do you remember the ingenious Samsung ad about the Apple dongles? The S21 is a flagship for a cheaper but still flagship price. They removed features and made compromises in the last few models, but come on‚Ä¶ What&#39;s the deal with removing the expansion slot? Driving everybody towards OneDrive, preferably the paid version?"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T23:09:17Z,"I think it would have been better, if they call this phone as SE version instead. Samsung is popular of so many features including SD Card support, Heart rate sensor, MFC, 3.5 MM jack, curved edges on sides, best performance, and so on.... I think after dropping so many thing, the next thing to drop is the letter S from the Samsung Galaxy S series phones... and just simply call it as another variant of a Samsung phone... I don&#39;t know what Samsung is upto, but it might be a sign that they are now lack of innovation and went to cost cutting mode, which is clearly a step to start on the downfall."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T22:55:36Z,"I do wish people including Samsung would stop advertising and entertaining the digital (space) zoom. It looks like hot garbage, I have the Note 20 Ultra and anything past around 10 times (maybe 20) is unusable, you wouldn&#39;t share it or use it. You can tell even Samsung are embarrassed by it because in the ad for the S21 Ultra when they talk about it instead of filling the screen with the image like they do with the pictures they show off. They shrink it down and only show it for a very short time. Its marketing BS to try one up Apple which takes away from actual work the sensor and optics engineers and designers do. <br><br>Instead of spending time on &#39;space zoom&#39; they could do with working on the over sharpening and heavy noise reduction I&#39;ve seen on every Samsung I&#39;ve had since the Note 2. Slightly noisey, naturally sharper images would look better and it would also help if it didnt keep trying to over expose highlights when its in slightly challenging lighting condition there&#39;s no need. My Pixel 2 didnt do either of these things."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T22:00:19Z,"Here I was thinking that because Apple doesn&#39;t allow apps to use NFC to do their own payment apps like on Android, so that we are stuck with this stupid bluetooth proximity nonsense with MobilePay as that&#39;s the only way to pay with iPhones if you don&#39;t use specific banks supporting Apple Pay, even though literally everything everywhere allows NFC payments - MST definitely sounds like even worse situation. I don&#39;t see why phones would need to have specific hardware for something like magnet stripe payment systems. <br>Actually, because magnet stripes are insecure (easy to copy, literally just number of a card in a stripe that&#39;s magnetic) they no longer work at all and you are required to use chip or NFC as those are more secure and verified, meaning that you can&#39;t even use MST anymore if I&#39;m reading this correctly."

Are people demanding this type of feature to do high end work? I don&#39;t know anyone that does. Just curious.

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T21:48:02Z,No headphone jack was a dumb move on the S20 but the removal of MST and no microSD card slot AND no charger made it impossible for me to go Samsung. I am holding on to my S10e for as long as I can and moving on to an Android phone that doesn&#39;t copy every stupid thing Apple does.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:45:58Z,Intro is a slow-mo Overwatch lootbox reveal. Change my mind.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:44:11Z,"This a good review and you made a good case to buy. Bravo Samsung. <br><br>Some of that stuff they removed I wasn&#39;t using anyway. Like I can&#39;t count on my hand all the times I used maxed out zoom on any Samsung in all these years. I take tons of pictures, but my subjects are typical and even on vacation, I&#39;m not trying to be the world&#39;s best photographer. I&#39;m just capturing moments.<br><br>However...1080p is still 1080p. And as much media I consume, I can tell the difference. Trust me I&#39;m not the ass who feels like if 8k is out there they&#39;ve gotta have it...but I know 1440p."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:43:23Z,"i upgraded from an S10+ to the S21, and the only difference i can feel is the smaller body, which is good. the S10+ was too big for 1 hand useage. and the flat screen which is fantastic."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:40:11Z,The note 4 rip to it was the best Samsung phone ever Long live note 4 how does the note 4 have a better screen than that Galaxy s21 note 4 was a 1440 p display how 8 years later there&#39;s a 1080 display screen for more than what the know for was back then please explain.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:40:04Z,Samsung peaked at s10 series... üò§
dhAmMXCBIcg,3,2021-02-03T21:39:00Z,I like the Thanos color design. Which is fitting since half the features were removed.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:37:30Z,"Them getting rid of MST is a deal-breaker for me, unbelievable that they wouldn&#39;t go forward with that"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:36:05Z,Stop promoting cell phone companies fockory it&#39;s not cool at all what is cell phone companies are doing splicing features making three phone iterations not cool for the customer great for the company we&#39;re getting less for the same price we would buy a premium phone for to get the premium features you have to pay the most that&#39;s a betrayal to customers.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:34:03Z,Don&#39;t know why but this phone desing is fire.
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T21:33:33Z,"Got the S20 but won&#39;t upgrade with out expandable storage. That&#39;s BS. Hello, LG"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:32:41Z,I think maybe focus
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:30:52Z,Expendable storage is nice I don&#39;t know why they don&#39;t support on  normal S21

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:30:04Z,I would argue that 1080p is actually better than 1440p because the improvement to battery life is way more noticeable than the improvement to screen resolution
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:29:33Z,How do i get the google news instead of samsung daily? Cant find a good solution can someone help?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:29:30Z,Samsung is great phone only if they don&#39;t put their s**t chip that makes me want to switch the brand and i&#39;m a user of their phones from years but at the end of this year i&#39;m switching from Samsung i hope the iPhone 13 still won&#39;t have 120hz display or i&#39;m becoming an iPhone user.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:28:33Z,Dope intro
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:23:46Z,"So now if you want decent amount of storage space, you have to shell out more money for the 256GB model...there goes the 200$..and 256GB is still little for 4K/8K video and flac offline music"
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T21:22:00Z,Nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:20:51Z,"they dropped it by $200 because they raised it by like $250-500 from the s20/ultra. s7-s10 were similarly priced, s20 got nuclear, then now s21 came back down to a sort of normal price with the ultra keeping the $1k+ tag."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:12:21Z,"Am I the only one really missing that Samsungish edge style display? Just a little curve, I like it much more than flat display and also it was something related to Samsung. :("
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T21:05:11Z,The Intro is genius!
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-03T21:02:49Z,Samsung&#39;s this year s21 lineup is impressive. I am really living the design. I am looking to upgrade ü•≥

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T20:57:15Z,Anyone have any good screen protector recommendations? I had two and both pretty much negate the thumb recognition

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T20:53:54Z,"yes i did notice the Daft Punk poster, what is this guy talking about ?"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T20:52:59Z,BTW cool daft punk frame in the background.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T20:50:43Z,Does anyone know what kinda software Marques uses to make such slick intros? <b>fingers crossed its not too expensive</b>
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T20:50:38Z,That is pretty amazing that Samsung managed to reduce the price by $200 without any major sacrifices to the phone&#39;s overall quality.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T20:50:24Z,Me watching this on my iphone 5s. LOL
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T20:49:48Z,How did you get C2C in your videos?!
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T20:49:16Z,"Why do you keep justifying how these companies keep ripping people off? Manufacturers hit a sensitive number with $1k and people were wanting cheaper phones again and now Samsung and others reduce the cost while keeping their margins comparable and you come around with &quot;would you notice?&quot;. And next year it&#39;s a bit more expensive again until we have plastic phones at $1k too. Instead, influencers like you should be campaigning against this price hike."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T20:48:08Z,200 cheaper  yea sure its more expensive with out charger or earphones or wire
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T20:47:52Z,"stil contemplating upgrading from my S10+. initial reaction was absoluytely not. losing storage and 1440p and little bit of size and a few other things. but If i sit and think about it, do i need or would i notice any of those? Samsung has a great trade in value, so could potentially upgrade for mad cheap. still weighing the options."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T20:46:54Z,I have a question! Is the Samsung 21 plus the same as the normal versions? (Except for the size of course)
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T20:45:35Z,"I also think the camera bump has taken quite an agreeable turn with the 21s. Clever, Samsung! Clever! Although most of the products you review are way out of my budget (still rocking S7), I keep coming back for more of your excellent videos. Maybe the fleeting thought that one day I might catch a giveaway plays a role. Who knows?"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T20:45:32Z,Looks like a very nice phone with very many things implemented right. I like its form factor with the ideal screen size and its flatness. One thing they could make a cost-saving compromise is putting the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone (which could add extra functionality with its swipe feature) and retain the SD card slot.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T20:45:26Z,"I&#39;m so happy that you did this. Every other reviewer was focusing on the drawbacks of the S21 and making it the highlight of the review. It&#39;s so ridiculous because I truly believe that people don&#39;t notice. When I had the S10+ I downgraded my resolution to 1080p and completely couldn&#39;t tell the difference. Plastic back? I have a phone case, as most people do. Expandable storage? I&#39;m not going to exceed 125gb of storage, and if I do I&#39;ll just upload the photos to my computer and call it a day. This phone is not defined by what it&#39;s missing, it&#39;s defined by what it has for $800 (or even cheaper with carrier deals)."

Let&#39;s not pretend that losing Micro SD support and a charger in the box isn&#39;t something that you wouldn&#39;t notice

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T19:27:06Z,"In this price range, missing expandable storage and headphone jack is bigger deal then on Ultra.<br>On the top of that in European country where I live, we get Exynos which is still worse than Snapdragon, and we do not get 256GB option. So why would I by Samsung instead of iPhone??? Because it is 50 or 100eur cheaper. No thank you."

Let me just explain, my S9 has LED notification, AUX, expandable memory, headphones and a charger, all included with the price and the new model, doesn&#39;t have any of those?!

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T18:52:11Z,You don&#39;t seem very interested to point out the down sides in any of your reviews. So consulting your reviews to decide if I buy something or not is misleading.
dhAmMXCBIcg,4,2021-02-03T18:50:38Z,man this literally seems as being paid high for pushing even bad things as good

Looks more like a Samsung made promotional video than a real review of well compromised smartphone. Oh yeah, everyone will notice the loss of the charger and the SD card slot btw."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T18:47:45Z,Great review. You mentioned this is the best bang for the buck on the line up. But how about the S21+? Would you still buy it or is it worth paying the extra USD 200 for the Ultra?

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T18:33:04Z,I can see this review to be biased. <br>1440p and 1080p and you say you wouldn&#39;t notice? Plastic vs metal/glass back and you wouldn&#39;t notice?<br>Hmmm....
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T18:31:48Z,"Firstly wouild like to say great video as always but this phone sucks, its not cheaper here but as expensive if not more than the S20 when it released. I am a long time samsung fan who has bought every single phone they have sold since the S2 and I have skipped this phone, removing the charging brick  and the memory card was too much for me. I have invested in a 256gb mmc. I dont get why they removed the removable storage it makes no sense."

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T18:27:08Z,It dropped this year alright people are already dropping them once and it&#39;s broken. I hardly call that a good phone. At least my LG V60 isn&#39;t fragile trash like that.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T18:26:39Z,"you know what, at first I was like this is not a good phone, but you did justify the downgrades, I guess the only thing now that I would miss the most is extended storage."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T18:13:03Z,"The price is cheaper, yes, but it&#39;s only because last year&#39;s s20 had crazy prices. $799 is not that cheap compair to s10 and other base s-models from the past, and they all have mst, sd card support, 2k displays and glass backs."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T17:54:18Z,The phone is cheaper but it doesn&#39;t come with a charging brick
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T17:54:04Z,"I got mine a week ago in white with 256GB. It has the Exynos 2100. I also have a S20+ 5G with the Exynos 980 (I guess it&#39;s called that) and wanted a smaller device. So I ordered an iPhone 12 Mini as well with 256GB. The Mini is great, but the S21 is just super awesome. The new Exynos is WAY more efficient then in the S20+ . The S20+ drains about 11-13% of Battery in Standby at night. The S21 only drains about 3% in the same amount of time, which is equal to the iPhone 12 Mini. The Display is very nice, and it looks just cool. The plastic is of really high quality and has nothing to do with those old Samsung plastic phones which were nasty as hell. This really feels great. So I will go for the S21 instead of the iPhone 12 Mini (even though it&#39;s also a very good phone). Once you are used to a 120Hz Display, it&#39;s hard to get back."
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-03T17:53:49Z,You forgot to mention that the S6 has a better display than the S21

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T17:46:29Z,A man from China went out of his way and find out from the China manufacturers how much it would actually cost to build the exact same model of the iPhone 12 pro max. The hardware costed only 400 US dollars equivalent excluding the A14 bionic chip. And the iPhone 12 pro max retails at 1500US dollars.

No MST on Samsung Pay in theUnited States, No sdcard support on no S21 models, No charger, No headphones, poor 1080p displays on the S21 and S21Plus, poor unboxing experience (NOSALE) I look forward to extremely poor sales on S21 models which Samsung deserves this isn&#39;t 2015 when they did the same sdcard bullshit to the Note5 and S6EdgePlus. Poor sales means they won&#39;t fuck with the Note21Ultra or Fold3 come September."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T17:21:10Z,What&#39;s 9+10?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T17:20:55Z,"I understand Samsung likely removed MST since few people used it, but I think the reason few people used it was because few people knew about it. I think it was one of the few notable features that really made the Samsung Galaxy S series (and LG G series) stand out from other smartphones. I believe with some more advertising from Samsung about their MST feature, more people would have used it (and some may have even bought a Samsung over another phone for that feature.) With LG possibly leaving the smartphone market in a year or two (I really hope they don&#39;t), the number of devices with MST may become even more limited. <br><br>I&#39;m against gimmicks for the sake of gimmicks, but it is unfortunate how phones are losing more and more features (headphones jacks, micro SD card slots, removable batteries, IR sensors, heart rate monitors ‚Äî all available on the S5, which had an MSRP of $650, and MST, which was available since the S6 (MSRP of $600 on some carriers, more on others)). <br><br>I can live without some of those features (don&#39;t need micro SD if plenty of storage available on the device, don&#39;t need removable battery if it&#39;s easy to disassemble the phone and replace it myself, I don&#39;t really need an IR sensor or heart rate monitor, though some people certainly may want the latter), but I do l really like having a headphone jack, and MST is a great feature to have.<br><br>Still, I&#39;m glad they lowered the price in mostly good ways for this device (1080p is fine with me, plastic back is lighter and won&#39;t shatter, etc.), but still too expensive for me to consider it over something like a Pixel 4a: $350 vs $800, and that&#39;s the MSRP (not that I need a new phone now, but in case mine were to break). Getting a used or refurbished Pixel 4a would be even cheaper (plenty of those since it&#39;s been about half a year). If Samsung is charging $800, it better do a lot more than a $350 phone, and I&#39;m just not seeing what features it&#39;s offering over it that I really care about (sure, it has 3 back cameras, but I rarely see anyone actually use anything but the main camera). Nonetheless, I&#39;m glad they&#39;re experimenting with some of their other phones like the Galaxy Fold: it&#39;s out of my price range but that phone at least offers notable functionality not present on cheaper phones. The Z Flip is also neat (though I think the Moto Razr has better aesthetics, even if the hardware is better on the Flip.) Good to see Samsung is experimenting though."

Miss the headphone jack too. And the memory card was a useful feature. Also heart rate monitor is gone which I used a lot. I do like the phone but it doesn&#39;t feel like a good Samsung device because of the missing feature that Samsung are good at packing in.

And it&#39;s a function no one else has. <br><br>If you find that usage is not what is expected the first thing to do is advertise it and get the info out there.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T16:23:50Z,"Samsung removing MST is really not a big deal overall not because it didn‚Äôt work well, but because of how much a hassle it was to convince the store clerk that your Samsung phone works but not an iPhone.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:55:19Z,"for me, a big box they didn&#39;t check is the glass back, I hate plastic backs... just the truth that it&#39;s a plastic back hurt me. And I prefer the look of s21 ultra. But it&#39;s too big for my hand. I stayed with my s20+, which is still a bit too big for me."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:50:59Z,"They basically killed off their own Samsung Pay with this model then. MST was a killer feature, especially since so many retailers don&#39;t support Samsung Pay, just Apple and Google."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:50:54Z,Damn! Why MKBHD&#39;s background always matches with the colour of the phone?   <br>S21- Phantom Violet- Violent pillar <br>S21 ultra- Phantom Black- Most the things in Matte Black

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:49:46Z,Only a matter of time until Apple or Samsung asks the MKBHD team to make intros for them
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:49:12Z,"I wish the base S21 came in Phantom Black, I would have already gotten one"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:49:00Z,"Other advantaje samsung have over let&#39;s say xiaomi its samsung is a mainstream brand so is easier to find cases, screen protector, screens, batteries, etc."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:34:04Z,Its like Sony putting a 4K display on a phone honestly pointless as the screen is so small you would have to put your eyes right up to it to notice the differences

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:29:38Z,So s21 or s20 FE?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:29:04Z,This is to Samsung once my note 9 dies I will stop buying your brand because of lack SD memory expansion slot. Just look back to the Galaxy S6 people where not happy

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T15:27:10Z,Phone is $200 cheaper but it still cost a half a liver
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:26:04Z,I just have to say it... The phone most ignored by tech reviewers after each February Samsung launch is the plus phone
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:25:58Z,Wallpaper?????!!!!
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T15:25:52Z,It&#39;s 1.100 USD here. No thanks!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:25:32Z,"better 1080p on a 1080p display than 1080p on a 1440p display, makes a huge difference trust me"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:22:15Z,"I think low light capability is better in the S20 than the ultra,didn‚Äôt cheat BTW!"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:19:20Z,Love seeing that Sony A1! It is going to be a hard pass on anything S21 for me due to the loss of expandable memory. If they continue leave out the expandable storage I am going to switch from Samsung all togeather.

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T15:17:44Z,"Considering all the sacrifices, no matter how small, I still feel like the S20 is a better buy than the S21. Only way the S21 makes sense is if you go with the Ultra."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:03:53Z,They lower the price this year and raise it next year. Trade values and promos will be lower. You end up paying more out of pocket on the next one. Resetting the purchase slate.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T15:03:24Z,Just too good... Fantastic the way you have gone about making this video. Super impressive.. Information only on need to know basis.. That&#39;s all most of the crowd will ever need! Cheers

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T14:40:14Z,"I don&#39;t care about 1080p, plastic back, laser auto focus or camera bump.  BUT, removing MST technology and expandable memory is a deal breaker for me.  Samsung Pay is/was one thing that Samsung did better than ANY other cell phone manufacturer and now they remove it for some reason.  The Note 20 Ultra will likely be my last Samsung phone unless they reverse direction.."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T14:40:04Z,"To be honest, its only right that the price goes down cause since 2017 we keep loosing stuff like SD card slots, screen area (which now is coming back due to losing the camera notches, thank God), headphone jacks and price went up fo no good reason. And price for all round great phone in 2017 was around 700-800.<br><br>To be honest 2017 was peak year for phones and since then nothing revolutionary hasn&#39;t happened and asking 1000+ Euros for just adding 3 cameras isn&#39;t justified. <br><br>All of the above is generalization and not about this phone in the video."

The screen is more colorful and vibrant but when I look at one and then a day later look at the other, I can tell. I LOVE the plastic back, light weight, low cost, and never cared about expandable storage since 97% of people should be using free unlimited Google photos storage (before we have to start paying for it). Even in a year following a pandemic I expect the top of the line from Samsung and I am a tad disappointed, I feel that they are holding back on us a little bit for next year."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T14:18:46Z,The floating phone shot..... HOW?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T14:18:14Z,"So I&#39;m really hoping I didn&#39;t just get screwed by Exynos, but I bought the Galaxy S21+ and generally it&#39;s a very fast and responsive phone as you say. However, the moment I open up the camera, it is an utter lag fest. This is (theoretically) the most high-end phone I have ever owned. It is also the worst camera experience I have ever experienced on a smartphone because half the time it is so laggy that the shutter button will not even trigger. Europeans beware... the Exynos 2100 may not be what Samsung promised."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T14:17:36Z,"That&#39;s funny because here in Brazil, this phone is R$1.000,00 more expensive than the S20 and came with no charger and no headphone."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T14:06:31Z,"Most reviewers get the Snapdragon version. Here in the UK, we need more comparisons with the Exynos. When Samsung used the Qualcomm in their S20, that was great. But now we see the (admittedly new) Exynos in the S21 and S21+. I still get the feeling we might be being short-changed. I&#39;m holding out on any upgrade until I see more videos on how the two stack up against each other."

dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-03T13:58:22Z,Seems like samsung took the features away that people loved about them: expandable storage and the mst being the biggest 2 for me. Those were the features you would use in a pinch and then if someone noticed it was kinda a wow factor like when a clerk sees you pay with your phone on a terminal that doesnt accept samsung pay

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T13:02:13Z,Samsung is not hitting the sales point and starts dropping prices and getting Marques to back it up.. They probably want to enter the medium end market with Xiaomi and Huaweiw while still differentiating in the Ultra like Apple did with the 12 Pro max this year.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T13:01:30Z,You tout how these phones are capable of 120 fps but your videos mostly seem to top off at 30 fps. Why? Or have I heard you wrong?

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:54:03Z,This phone is obviously great. At the same time I don&#39;t find it very exciting
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:53:52Z,what i can is  watching  nothing more would give me as giveaway
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:51:56Z,Watching this with my new S21
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:51:12Z,Such a great video ! <br>Is there a review for the S21+ coming as well? <br>That&#39;s the new Samsung phone I am most excited for.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:50:07Z,"I am using the S20FE, and I have the 120 Hertz off just because if battery. I was an iphone user so I&#39;m used to 60 anyway. Battery is one of my pillars to a great smartphone so I&#39;ll sacrifice the refresh rate."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:49:43Z,It actually does look better in the icon skin

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:47:29Z,Biased
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:47:00Z,who cares about new phones we all have great devices anyway
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:46:58Z,"People really think a brand new phone is going to be cheaper than last year‚Äôs model at an exact point of time. It‚Äôs only natural for the older phones to have gotten cheaper over those 12 months that have passed and you shouldn‚Äôt expect them to be more expensive than the new one that came out literally a couple of days ago. The price drop is in starting price, you should compare it to the prices of the S20 series when they came out, not one year later."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:46:30Z,"no microSD slot is a dealbreaker.  It is not to save money in production,<br> but to make money on phones with more storage even though it <br>doesn&#39;t  cost them much more for more  storage they take big money for it so<br>&quot;they did it to be able to lower the price&quot; is bs.<br><br><br><br>I have been using Samsung for many years but now they are just as greedy as Apple. if they want to sell overpriced <br>phones ... fine! but don&#39;t pretend like you do it for consumers samsung."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:46:19Z,"Everyone talking about price drops and in europe it&#39;s the same as last year. So basically we get less, for more."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:45:53Z,"I hated what they were doing. No sd, no charger, no earphones. I was ok with inclusion of the probuds, but preorder only and now its gone to a wireless charger and a fitness watch,. I missed it cause of travel restrictions. Its covid people cant get out, I kinda feel its a gimmick by samsung. I might switch to the hated iphone, atleast it has high 2ndhand value as i wait for something better."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:45:02Z,can you really even tell the difference between 1440p and 1080p anyways? 420 PPI is still incredibly high. I doubt you would notice even side by side.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:44:34Z,Better Portrait mode
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:44:19Z,Review the Sony a1 please!!!! :c
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:43:53Z,Reviewers should meet up to discuss guidelines for phone sizes. Like;<br> Small: Easy one hand operation by average female hand size in the continent with the smallest avg hand size.<br><br>Medium: from easy to use single handed with average hand but too big to quallify for small.<br><br>Big: Easy one hand use for the top 15% biggest hands of the world population.<br><br>Phablet: Anything bigger than big but smaller than tablet.<br><br>Easy one hand use can be defined by   the ability to touch the diagonaly opposite upper corner of the screen  while the diagonaly opposite downside corner can rest on the side of the hand below the pinky.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:43:37Z,It wont last more than s20 and its not better for 99% people.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:43:24Z,But can we still stream 1440p YouTube video&#39;s? Even with the 1080p screen...?

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:41:45Z,as much as it excels in hardware the software will always be the weak point of samsung only if it releases a mobile phone with vanilla android i will be interested in buying it

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:41:27Z,What Samsung did with the S21 is what OnePlus was doing right for years. Removed the &quot;gimmicks&quot; and focused on the essential to keep the price low.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:41:23Z,Background music is not we expect from mkbhd .....ur simplicity is famous
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:41:23Z,this is the highest end production of a YouTube video ever. this is the gold standard of YouTube videos

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:37:40Z,Really I don&#39;t feel the design. My note 10 plus still the best
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:36:33Z,Samsung is turning into Apple smh I left Apple for a reason! SD card resolution more options
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:36:01Z,I have the S21. I love the smaller size and the feel of the phone in  the hand. Cameras are great as always. Bit underhwlemed by the whole 120Hz hype. Somehow the scrolling on my OP6 feels much faster (not smoother!) Great phone all round.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T12:34:51Z,Is this one better than the oneplus 8 pro?

That&#39;s cool and all but I would like to see a more technical approach. Like a focus on the android experience. The notifications are like this, the apps perform like this, the call quality in terms of speaker/mic. Maybe a comparison with an old samsung version. And yes I know that its a niche. Something that would say to a customer, Listen if you upgrade from your s8/s9/s10/s20 you get these features."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:40:54Z,Am I the only one thinking these portrait shots look shit? Like the blur looks way worse than on the iPhone and literally the first two photos he shows appear to have jarring cutout errors

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:39:59Z,Can I still use samsung pay with my s21ultra ?
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-03T11:39:53Z,"I think it&#39;s funny how MST is an enthusiast feature that they dropped. While I agree with the sentiment, I wonder how much the average person used MST, not realizing it wasn&#39;t Android Pay? Now, upon upgrading, those same people will wonder why their tap-to-pay features no longer work. As an enthusiast who knew what they were using when those payments went through, I think it was a mis-step on Samsung&#39;s part. It will handicap more than just enthusiasts. What&#39;s more, they killed it for the whole line up. A consolation prize would have been to at least see the feature on the plus or ultra versions."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:39:06Z,"It&#39;s 200$ less only in some regions, in Romania it&#39;s no difference due to VAT and other import taxes. I&#39;m ok with S21, better than S20 because they fixed the issues for baterry consumption and throtheling from Exynos from last year and now 120 Hz it&#39;s better implemented. The cameras are the same with S20, just the software is different which will be updated. I don&#39;t mind for plastic back, I use anyway a case."
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T11:38:56Z,"No Micro SD is not a good decision. That&#39;s the only thing I can&#39;t agree with you. It is required in 2021 especially with how much we use those phones, those Camera characteristics of crazy resolution + fps, and no need to switch so often considering how good those phones now are means that this phone should be used for next 2 years on average. Is that enough memory for all what this phone has to offer? I don&#39;t think so. Basically they want to push users into their partner Google&#39;s cloud system which somehow starts to be pay to play system soon. Micro SD is needed nowadays. It&#39;s a limiting factor not including it on those new smartphones."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:36:56Z,I&#39;m crying while holding my Exynos S20
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:36:12Z,"THE C2C Song track , oufff :x"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:34:40Z,What a niche start
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T11:34:39Z,‚ù§Ô∏è
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:34:06Z,"My friend got the S21 and he said that when he&#39;d game on it, it would overheat till it was too hot to hold, and the fps would drop. (Genshin Impact would claim it&#39;s overclocking on medium settings) he swapped it with the S21 Ultra and he said the ultra is better, but still gets pretty hot. (SD888 version)"
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T11:34:03Z,"Ight dawg, these intro song selections are getting more and more choice haha well done."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:33:49Z,Can you remove facebook app?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:33:42Z,No micro sd slot? No thanks
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:33:23Z,"I guess MST usage differs quite a bit between countries. In Korea where everything is pretty much done with credit cards and not many offer NFC payments, they kept it."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:32:43Z,"that is the point most ppl cannot differentiate bw very good FHD and QHD, apple is doing that for years and iphones have great battery after X. Sammy&#39;s will acknowledge that now, QHD as a spec is bullshit, there are FHD screens that look better than mediocre QHDs"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:32:32Z,"Senpai, your videos are ASMR to the eyes."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:32:13Z,"What about the s20 fe versus the s21, s20 fe doesn‚Äôt seem behind and delivers far better value"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:30:10Z,Can you Please compare s21 plus with s20 fe thanks üòä @mkbhd
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T11:29:32Z,"Happy with my Note 9.<br>Headphone jack, check.<br>No notch, check.<br>Heart rate sensor, check.<br>Expandable storage, check.<br>Honestly, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a new technology in recent smartphones that&#39;s worth it, and for me, the Note 9 was the last complete phone from Samsung."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:29:19Z,Focusing ?
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T11:29:17Z,I&#39;m still confused if I should upgrade to it from my s10e
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:28:29Z,Can I donate directly to the guy who made this intro?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:28:15Z,like that intro
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:27:52Z,Isn‚Äôt there a scratching problem with the plastic back?

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:27:17Z,That Dolly Zoom was sweet!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:27:05Z,I would not notice a price difference no. But thats because my plan pays 100% of the cost. And all I get is a setup fee. Plan monthly also same.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:26:00Z,this colorway kinda remindes me of Thanos
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:25:38Z,Sick intro üî•
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:25:33Z,"Sony a1, fuji GF100s???? And you call yourself a camera nerd"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:24:57Z,"Samsung had to reduce the price, as no one would buy it. S20 was a bit of a disaster: very expensive and had many problems. So they&#39;re forced to reduce price AND improve many glitches/shortcomings that S20 range had."
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T11:24:32Z,"The package would have been great if they kept the headphones, the brick, the sd card. But no, they had to follow apple. Thank God I left Samsung for OnePlus"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:24:30Z,New cutter?
dhAmMXCBIcg,5,2021-02-03T11:24:26Z,That animation at the start was sick. Whoever did that should get a raise.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:24:15Z,Is it dual SIM?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:23:36Z,Patiently waiting for the Note 21 lol

dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-03T11:22:22Z,Why the hell does this sound like Mark Ass Brownie trying to sell me this phone and justify the corner cutting than just him reviewing the damn thing.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:21:53Z,"My word, Samsung needs to honor you,......the tech world needs to honor you üëçüèæ"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:21:12Z,Samsung finally on the right track!!!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:20:36Z,Hands fuckin Down - That intro was higher in class than your jumps in your frisbee tournaments
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:20:10Z,That intro was sick
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:19:51Z,Why is C2C not credited?
dhAmMXCBIcg,4,2021-02-03T11:19:49Z,"Battery life is far more important than cramming a QHD display into a phone. 400+ppi is enough, people."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:19:47Z,Yes I noticed and I dont like when companies goes backward... in short S20 is more powerful then S21 (u already mentioned processor doesnt make difference nowadays u ll not notice)

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:19:31Z,If apple made a plastic iPhone...this guy would shit his pants and would keep bashing apple
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T11:19:29Z,"The removal of micro sd card and MST is a big deal. If you need the extra space, you will have to pay for the higher capacity model and therefore paying more for the device versus having the ability to add your own storage.  MST maybe no one will notice unless you use Samsung Pay a lot like myself."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:17:35Z,"If you get a chance, could you also please review the S21+? I want to see if it is worth it over the vanilla S21"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:17:21Z,Intro is getting better and better....
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:16:27Z,i really wish they kept the macro mode because i do so many close ups:(
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:15:46Z,Remember the days wehen apple was dissed for differentiating too much between their big/small phones and even between their pro and non pro phones. I feel like apple has bridged that gap and samsung has increased it. Not saying the phones are bad...but the gap is definitely bigger on Samsung phones vs apple phones
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:15:04Z,The intro is getting better by the day. Super Respect.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:14:56Z,Does the S21 plus also has a 1080p resolution ?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:14:14Z,Paid video

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:11:25Z,Hot take: Samsung is dropping the prices of the 21-lineup with 200$ to let the foldables take over that 1500-1700$ pricepoint. Meaning we should expect a pricedrop on Z Fold 3.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T11:10:55Z,"I miss the mst. Loved using samsung pay, dont have to take my wallet and credit card around with me. Off course the watch ‚åöis one way but sometimes I forget to wear it when I&#39;m charging it."

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T11:01:32Z,I love the design but no sd card is a dealbreaker. Doesn&#39;t help that they launched it for a higher price than the s20 here in Sweden :(<br>S20 launched for 9000<br>S21 launched for 9500

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T10:39:53Z,"Samsung tho, they only decrease the prices in economically well developed countries, which is kinda strange, considering that people who couldn&#39;t afford the previous generation of galaxy phones are probably living in less developed countries. Maybe they just did it so that it might appear cheaper, when in reality its even more expensive than last year for the rest of the world."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T10:37:56Z,What happened to the Galaxy S21 Plus? Is it worth considering buying? Or is it just a question of either S21 or S21 Ultra?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T10:37:43Z,Video paused. I thinks it&#39;s the shallow depth of field in the ultra
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T10:36:54Z,The production quality is way higher than the other Youtubers. ‚ù§Ô∏è
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T10:35:46Z,"Quick note: the third camera is not actually 3x optical zoom. It&#39;s a 64MP camera with the same lens setup as the main shooter. They&#39;re doing some crazy software shenanigans with it. You can quickly figure this out by switching camera modes and then cover lenses individually. Interestingly, sometimes it uses the main camera as a telephoto instead of the higher resolution sensor. I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s something to do with pixel size and optimizing for lighting as well. <br><br>I just think that it is of note, because it does not in fact have an optical telephoto lens which is a bit of a downside for camera geeks like me.  Not major, because software is 70% of the smartphone camera game right now, but of note."

Essentially exact same camera system, also has an OLED 1080p 120Hz display, also plastic, still has wireless charging, the 865 is pretty damn close to the Exynos 2100 in performance and in fact with the FE you keep expandable storage. Its also a fair bit cheaper too."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T10:32:32Z,actually prefer plastic on the back it makes it so much lighter and easier to hold especially with how big and long phones are these days the lighter weight makes one hand use much easier when pivoting the device to reach the opposing corners

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T10:30:02Z,I hate samsung phones beucase they focus more on camera. IDC abaut the camera. That&#39;s why i switched to xiaomi. I think xiaomi are more focused on performance. And i wont by samsung from now on for multiple reasons. For example the note siries (if they had a note id consider that cuz the spen) and the curve. Theese are the 2 most important things .

And no &quot;ultra&quot; camera setup?<br><br>To me this year the whole galaxy line and then the galaxy note line due to come out later this year is just so convoluted.

I&#39;ve had 1440p displays and SD support since my LG G3, and now in 2021 you want me to downgrade and be happy about it because Karen won&#39;t notice?<br><br>Samsung has a marketing department. Unless you work for it, stop excusing anti-consumer moves like this. It&#39;s not &quot;cheaper,&quot; they&#39;re just gouging you slightly less, and you&#39;re getting less for the money.<br><br>The S is the flagship. If you want a cut down affordable Galaxy they have innumerable lesser variants. Neutering the S is not something that should be celebrated."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T08:06:46Z,Taking away the expandable storage was a BIG mistake.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T08:05:43Z,This camera might be good at ultra wide

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T08:04:11Z,üòí the galaxy s21 is actually 100 dollars more expensive than last year. Since its predecessor is galaxy s20 FE.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T08:03:44Z,"Again, look at the pricing history of their previous flagships, the S20 (128GB 4G) went from 899 to 749 in a month. This 200 dollar price decrease is ONLY relevant when that ridiculous price drop within a month does NOT happen. Also, you&#39;re getting completely screwed over if you think you&#39;re getting a good deal taking it with a contract...."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:58:02Z,The intro is still not perfect deep black. Work on it to make it more battery efficient on oled panels.

Have you seen distorsion or artifacts in the ultrawide pictures(specially at the frames) ?<br>2. In terms of camera quality, is it better than google pixel 5, xiaomi mi 10 utra or MI 11? I am doubting about which one i should by. My priority is the camera...<br><br>Many thanks and congratulations for your great content!"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:50:01Z,"I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m the only one but, the front facing camera cut out in the middle  on recent Samsung phones is something I don&#39;t like."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:49:56Z,I really wish this specs in S10e/iphone 6s size phone.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:49:39Z,"For these specs and cutdown, the phone should have been 599, not 799. They pretty much proved that with the S20 FE. I mean the S10 was only 749 I think and maintained the superior build of the higher end phones from that generation, so it&#39;s already proven it would have worked. They just TRICKED people into thinking this was a great deal because of last year&#39;s ABSURD price hike. By comparison it seems good, but it isn&#39;t. They just increased profit margins. Not to mention the lack of a charger because Apple did it so Samsung has to follow suit for some fucking reason."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:49:38Z,That&#39;s just a camouflaged galaxy A series. So midrange. No need to praise Samsung on that.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:49:13Z,That DaftPunk wall frame in the background is legit.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:48:41Z,I‚Äôve come back to this video several times today just to watch that intro again.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:48:32Z,"As a usual of S20, I genuinely feel like buying S21 is a downgrade. Too many things is taken away compared to featured added into the phone. Worse of all, other than the US, in most countries it is more expensive than the S20 when it was release."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:48:06Z,"I‚Äôm note 10 plus user. No micro so card support in new s21 lineup is biggest issue for me. And because off that I will need to wait for note 21 and hope they will left it on, if not then move to another brand."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:30:00Z,"If taking out features is supposed to funnel high-end users to the S21 plus and ultra then they shouldn&#39;t have taken out the expandable storage and MST in the higher end phones.<br>It seems to me if anything it&#39;s going to make people want to buy the low-end phones because there isn&#39;t enough good stuff in the high-end phones to warrant the increase in price. I think removing expandable storage was incredibly dumb especially when you&#39;ve got an 8K camera on board. As an alternative they could have also offered a 1 TB version in the ultra. Hell they had that in the S10 then they get rid of it in the s20 and it&#39;s still gone now.<br>Lack of expandable storage is certainly is a deal killer for me.<br>I&#39;m sure the bean counters at Samsung figured out that most people don&#39;t use expandable storage anyway unfortunately power users... you know the kind of people that buy high-end flagship phones often do,  and I do therefore I won&#39;t buy buying a Samsung until they bring it back.."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:28:42Z,I wish they bring edge display back to at least base version of s series. Missed it so much.

dhAmMXCBIcg,19,2021-02-03T07:26:10Z,Who cares about plastic back phones when everyone uses case anyway. I never saw in my life someone using his phone without case. Plastic back everything!

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:24:13Z,I played around with the s21 and immediately thought it felt quite cheap because of the plastic back and the display. I would definitely not buy or recommend the phone.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:24:12Z,Is the S20 better than the S21 with the drop in price?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:24:03Z,People also noticed difference in vibro between s21 and others in series. So it&#39;s cheaper as well!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T07:23:58Z,"I understand samsung had to come into compromise with the specs so that they can reduce its price. But i don&#39;t  agree with the downgrade of the screen resolution  as it still has the high end chip 2100 as its brothers and is able to support  the 120hz feature on Qhd. They could then add a cheaper and a lower grade chip that would meet the performance limitations  that the rest of the hardware has, and reduce the price more"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T06:59:36Z,"It might be $200 down but it was more than $200 too expensive last year. The pricing for ultra especially at $1400 with a compromised camera, which was the sole reason for its existence and that price. I sometimes wonder why people still take SamDung seriously."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T06:59:06Z,"So, Marques.. Let me be brutally honest here... The only &quot;bad&quot; thing about this review is you trying to justify the dropped features by the price cut... I understand that the phone maybe great... But dropping features is a bad thing, especially when those dropped features can be found in much cheaper phones out there.. And in that context, I think Samsung is still overcharging for what they provide.. Those stuff are around for ages, and they literally cost pennies nowadays.."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T06:38:54Z,I loved samsung pay because of MST i never had to worry if i lost my card or forgot my wallet. Switched to an iphone and apple pay does not compare. lost my debit card and it was a nightmare until the replacement came.

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T06:33:51Z,"Anyone remember back in 2018 when everyone laughed and shamed apple for having a 1080p screen on their IPhone XR. Welp, turns out even Samsung realized that the pixel density difference between 1080p and 1440p isnt worth it."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T06:33:14Z,Checking all right important boxes

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T06:30:39Z,You make it sound as if samsung is doing us a favour by cutting cost and also selling you rubbish.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T06:23:21Z,"You barely notice the plastic back? I&#39;m surprised and disappointed, because it&#39;s the one thing you WILL notice right away!<br>After preordered the S21 for 760‚Ç¨ with 256GB and all the goodies, waiting 2 weeks, it&#39;s the first thing I noticed immediately and lost any excitement about the design, and the phone it self...<br>Everything else apart from the back sure is good, very good or ok, but the thing you feel everytime you hold the device in your hand, yes you notice!<br>The back felt cheaper than the A40, and of course, way cheaper than any glass or metal back, like the one on my Oneplus 5T.<br>I even think, making the back this kind of texturized and not smooth, makes it worse, because it was very slippery in my hands.<br>Dont get me wrong, plastic backs can feel good, like on my Sony Z3 Compact Tablet, or even of the cheap A40 (at least for me).<br>Also, I constantly had the feeling of being able to press it in, maybe because its such a slim and flexible back, looking at the teardowns...<br>If you would use a case, sure, you would not notice, but then, why have the better camera design in the first place?<br>As someone, who is using his phone without a case, just dont get the regular S21, and yes, even with ~250‚Ç¨ discount."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T06:21:53Z,What is your views s20 or s21?

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T06:14:43Z,"This is unlike Samsung, if I want a phone with features missing I‚Äôll just go buy an iphone"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T06:14:41Z,"I&#39;ll be honest I prefer the look of the camera setup on the S21 compared to the S21 Ultra and I bought the S21 Ultra.<br><br>I&#39;m not a camera nerd, I don&#39;t use any of the special camera features. All I wanted was the 1440p 120hz display and 512GB of storage, so I was forced to go with the S21 Ultra by default. If they had kept the expandable storage, I might have considered compromising on the screen, but I&#39;m running out of storage and I&#39;ve already got 366GB, so I didn&#39;t have any other option.<br><br>If Samsung had given us the S21+ with the 1440p 120hz display and kept the expandable storage, then that would have been the phone I bought. I also wouldn&#39;t have minded if they had used the same polycarbonate back that&#39;s on the S21, I put a polycarbonate backed case on my phone anyways and I like the feel and durability it provides.<br><br>The insane thing is that they could have done both of these things extremely easily, it&#39;s not even a stretch. Even if finding space in the phone to keep the expandable storage was an issue, I would be fine with downsizing the battery to 4500mAh in order to make the space.<br><br>I have no doubt that I&#39;ll love my Phantom Navy S21 Ultra, but they really missed an opportunity here to make the perfect phone."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:59:41Z,every time this channel posts a video the standard for production quality on YouTube goes up a little
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:59:20Z,This intro reminds me of Huawei P20 Pro review video
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:58:33Z,Does any one tell intro song name??

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:57:51Z,Have you ever thought about building your own PC? I‚Äôm honestly very curious as to what your set up would be or look like. You should do a PC build video!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:57:48Z,Have you watch the S21 drop test by CNET? So shocking ... do you think Samsung sacrifice the build quality?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:57:44Z,Petition to give his editor a raise...
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:57:39Z,the price dropped because of the 1080p screen
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:57:38Z,"Lol where I live the s21 costs $1000, s21+ is $1250 and the ultra is $1500."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:56:18Z,"I usually think Samsung phones are ugly, but I really like this design."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:56:08Z,The problem is that the SD card slot is missing.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:53:08Z,Upgraded from the s9 and enjoying the larger screen and battery size. Even if the word &quot;smaller&quot; was used throughout the vid lmao
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:52:59Z,That intro though
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:52:43Z,MST is the only thing I want in my new phone(
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:52:37Z,Gonna need that poster in the back.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:52:27Z,Where are those two other cameras? It must have 5 üì∑.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:51:48Z,This phone deserves this intro.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:51:39Z,I like the phone just wanted bigger battery &amp; better position for selfie camera on the side
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:51:23Z,Ur doing great bro<br>Thanx
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T05:51:15Z,S21+ RIP?<br>I&#39;m using it and I&#39;m waiting for the review because I have the f***ing exynos.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:51:15Z,I like the S21 overall. Just sent off my old s10+ to Samsung for trade-in. Can never go back to a 60hz screen.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:50:28Z,Mike conley underated ! lol
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T05:50:24Z,small with a flat screen and high pixel density is just the best possible phone combo... Whyyyyyyyy do they always cut the resolution on small flat screens. Suuuuucks.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:50:19Z,Every YouTuber is getting better at smoothly introducing their sponsors.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:50:03Z,Macro or 5g I‚Äôm betting
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:50:02Z,Is dynamic range better on S21 over S21 ultra?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:49:36Z,"What are your thoughts on the S21 plus? Iirc, last year&#39;s no S20 plus outsold the S20 ultra (maybe also the base model). I wish reviewers would talk about the middle ground between the 800 dollar phone and the 1200 dollar phone, because there is a third option overlooked by reviewers..."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:48:41Z,Best intro
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:48:27Z,Is no one else bothered by the fact that Marques thinks Conley is underated???
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:47:48Z,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhAmMXCBIcg&amp;t=393"">6:33</a> ig s21 can take portrait with it&#39;s 3x telephoto?.. that would be impeccable"
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T05:47:41Z,The ultra review is not yet available. You lied to us.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:47:17Z,i have my Samsung galaxy s9 on 720p and i don&#39;t see any real difference so yeah
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:46:36Z,Samsung : We will apply our money in our cheaper phones in the features <br>Apple : We will apply our money in materials
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:46:22Z,Bro I still have my s10 üò¢ doesn&#39;t feel good
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:46:02Z,"Hey mate, turn on flashlight in dark room and look at the back panel üòÄ Then you will see the cheap plastic üòâ"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:45:31Z,holyyyyy...the intro itself welcomes the video itself...
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:45:07Z,I switched from the s20 to 21 ultra    only wish they had nicer colors on the ultra
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T05:44:53Z,Could u compare a S21 to a S10+ Ceramic?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:44:51Z,dope video i like the intro MKBHD thumbs up...
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:44:36Z,Where&#39;s the galaxy S9 owners and how do you feel about the S21?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:43:59Z,"The removal of expandable storage along with smaller baseline internal storage (Note10+ is 256gb minimum vs 128gb on all S21 models) is a greedy cash grab and nearly cancels out the price drops in my opinion. The S21 ultra should have higher internal storage and expandable storage seeing as how you are already paying a lot for it. It&#39;s the S6 all over again sadly, looks like an amazing phone otherwise. Here&#39;s hoping they revert these changes on the 2022 models."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:43:46Z,I love the new intro!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:43:02Z,You create such informative and helpful video reviews
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:42:59Z,Anytime I&#39;m like. Hey I know how that intro was made. It&#39;s cool<br><br>Mkbhd: hah! Keep dreaming.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:42:48Z,My wife is coming from a s9 I am trying to talked her I to this
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:42:42Z,"As soon as I realised that, it is a paid promotion video from Samsung üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:42:37Z,When you asked about one camera feature missing on ultra but present in regular s21 I thought you would say 960fps slow motion video from the main sensor.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:42:28Z,I don&#39;t get it seriously 200 dollars they charge for glass back only<br>I get it they want to make money but shouldn&#39;t they be charging 300$ or little more then the actual manufacturing cost?<br>Now they are charging way over 600$ for the same
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:42:21Z,No micro sd no fiesta amigo
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:42:15Z,watched that intro for 10 times and still it looks..... jawdroppingly  stunning..
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:42:11Z,Watching this on my S21...<br>I think i made right choice üòÖ
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:42:10Z,I have doubt about camera glass. In case of phone drop on sides it can break camera glass as it&#39;s attached with common metal frame.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:42:03Z,"The greatest man in history is Jesus. He had no servant yet they called him master . He had no degree , yet they called him teacher .

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:41:37Z,I wonder if Samsung is going to make an s21/s21 ULTRA &quot;FE&quot; with MST and micro SD expansion. I wouldn&#39;t mind paying extra to have those features added back since I always use it.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:40:24Z,"S21 Accessories Pricing:<br>Camera case.  $60<br>Screen protector: $15<br>Charger: $75<br>High speed USB C cable:. $25<br>No micro SD card slot, no headphone jack, nor adapter, no banking at dumb terminal transmitter:.  Priceless.<br><br>Pain in rectum:.  $200"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:40:17Z,sick intro
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:40:14Z,that opening sequence tho
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T05:39:56Z,"Samsung is way on top of Apple when it comes to Phones, but Apple tricked people into its ecosystem where iPhones are the norm!"
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-03T05:39:48Z,I don&#39;t need those extra camera&#39;s of the ultra but iI literally need a qhd+ display...
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:39:47Z,"Honestly...the lack of MST is the reason I will stay on the S9 for now. It&#39;s also the reason why I still rock the gear s3 frontier edition. <br>I&#39;m annoyed at the lack of sd storage but it&#39;s fine. I never used it for more storage, I just used it to make switching to a new phone instant. Sd cards are water proof, shock proof, dust proof, etc. My phone can be crushed and all my content on the sd card is most likely fine."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:39:29Z,Hot take - I don‚Äôt think he knows what calculus is üßê

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:38:53Z,I had to listen to that intro 3 times

dhAmMXCBIcg,5,2021-02-03T05:37:47Z,MKBHD drops mind blowing intro !<br>Me after seeing dislikes on the video : Are you guys blind ?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:37:02Z,Hot take: the 1440p/120hz decision last year was a preemptive marketing move because Samsung had hedged their bets on downgrading to 1080p for this phone and they just wanted the user telemetry to confirm it.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:37:02Z,damn intro!!!!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:36:47Z,I really can‚Äôt notice mate....720p display here.

You should have positioned the phones the same way, because it seems like it&#39;s the very same focal length despite the indication 0.6x vs 0.5x."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T05:12:14Z,Well in terms of your goal mentioned on wave form to make shots people should strive to achieve but unique and complex enough to make it hard to replicate is well demonstrated by that fire intro. Also while I like the look of the s21 defiantly stands out cant say upgrading from my 10e is viable hoping within the next 3 years the in screen selfie camera will be better developed and adopted as till than cant really say I need more power than my 10e gives. And with my desktop being 60hz on both monitors no reason to bump my phone for that aspect either. Great stuff as always

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:54:23Z,Not gonna lie this is the phone I always wanted. Much stuff of the super premium phones just exist to make them &quot;premium&quot; without actually adding any usability or noticable improvement besides the spec sheet

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:52:18Z,"Glad he talked about how the screen looks fine. So many people with a fundamental lack of understanding around how digital displays work are out talking shit. An FHD display is totally fine at this screen size. Especially when there are other elements bolstering the overall image quality. I have a S21+ and the screen easily looks superior to my S10+ display despite the lower resolutions. That&#39;s due to refinements made to the panels. This display is brighter, shows color more accurately, and displays less off axis color shift. AND it actually looks a bit sharper than my work issued N20 Ultra. This is likely due to that display being QHD but rendering internally at FHD to maintain 120fps. An upscaled image will ALWAYS look worse than a native image. Samsung, I think, was wise to implement these FHD displays. Because in addition to all of that, driving fewer physical pixels also means better battery life."

dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-03T04:37:53Z,"First off its not a real saving as last few years it was pushed up in price by $280 this is just Samsung not ripping off there customers.<br>In 2018, the price of the Galaxy S9 was $719<br>In 2019, the price of the Galaxy S10 was $899<br>In 2020, the price of the Galaxy S20 was $999<br>In 2021, the price of the Galaxy S21 was $799"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:37:27Z,"What are your thoughts on Exynos 2100 version? Need a performance comaparison and how does it fare against Snapdragon 888. Except USA and China, all the countries are getting exynos chipset."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:34:54Z,Samsung sells you this phone for $700 and doesn&#39;t expect you to buy Samsung subscriptions
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:34:53Z,S21 will do lens switch better

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:33:34Z,They dropped the price so they can sneak the price back up later
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:33:31Z,Great video but even better soundtrack

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:32:18Z,S21 series are not cheaper than S20 in Europe. Along with the exynos chip that we get it&#39;s a no brainer we have to wait for OP 9 pro to be released or get a Xiaomi...
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:31:56Z,Waiting for the S21 FE
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:31:41Z,Is a S21 Plus review coming?

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:30:21Z,Your intro wow
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:30:16Z,"Big shout-out to dbrand. I bought their Teardown skin for my S20 Ultra, and only realized the day after I ordered it that they&#39;re based in Canada. Well, the skin arrived the day after THAT and took less than five minutes to install to my satisfaction. And it looks GREAT. So if you want to get some MKBHD merch, an ICONS skin is definitely a piece worth considering."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:29:38Z,why am i even seeing this video!!<br>s21 is laughing with is cameras at my 16gb internal and 2 gb ram
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:29:33Z,By far the best MKBHD vid ever...Mind blown after that intro
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:28:53Z,I notice!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:28:53Z,You know what Marques. I wasn&#39;t going to get this phone until you posted this video. Good job.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:28:25Z,So we are now justifiying the quality drop on phones that are still $700
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T04:27:22Z,"Mistake there. Ultrawide cameras are identical between the two phones. Both at 13mm and 120 degrees. It&#39;s the main sensors that are different, hence the 0.5x and 0.6x.."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:27:05Z,Can we get fingerprint senors on the back of phones again? Please?
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-03T04:27:03Z,This is an awesome level of production! keep it up
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:26:49Z,"$850 for S20FE and $1200+ for S21. $100 cheaper than S20 line. I&#39;ve no need for 1440p, 5G, or the perf boost. I feel like basically any mid-range phone nowadays does the job just fine."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:26:48Z,Would you NOTEice ?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:26:11Z,At any given time much better than hyped One plus series which originally was designed to kill flagship but now being killed by flagships.
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T04:25:54Z,Hey what about that slide phone from oppo ?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:25:47Z,"Oh yes, the thanos phone"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:23:45Z,"Less than $200?<br>Philippines Shops: Increase it by $500<br>They won&#39;t notice, besides its latest."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:23:37Z,Is it worth it to upgrade from the s20?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:22:51Z,Please make a video on s20+ vs s21+ and is it really worth upgrading to S21+ considering that there are 4 cameras on the S20+
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T04:22:51Z,Calm down with that intro!<br>Nice
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:21:54Z,SO to DAFT PUNK!!!!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:21:54Z,So since Note 20. Samsung back to plastic phones again?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:21:48Z,"Upgraded from the S20 to the S21 for $95 and it was definitely a good choice. Aesthetics alone were worth it. Although, RIP mst."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:21:29Z,This video seems different than his other videos. I Love It.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:21:19Z,"This is probably the first time that I disagree with you Marquess. Everything you described I don&#39;t think it is a bang for the buck. <br>Honest fan of your videos, just disagree to this one"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:21:02Z,Crazy that I bought my Poco X3 for 200 dollars... And it does basically everything this phone does
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:20:52Z,no MST?????<br>WTF????<br>I might have to return my S21.. <br>I actually loved that feature the most. Iphones could not do it and I would rub it in my friends faces all the time
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:20:42Z,The intro killed me
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:20:39Z,U&#39;ll become Apple one day
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:20:29Z,Anyone else watching this on the s21? Just me? Ok...

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:19:42Z,"Is it really an issue that they removed MST? Do many countries even use that anymore?<br><br>I&#39;ve used my phone as my only form of payment for years now and I don&#39;t think I can ever remember using MST, everything has been NFC by default for about 10 years now in Australia. I know the US is a little behind on tap payments but I thought they&#39;d have NFC too by now. What countries don&#39;t use NFC?"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:19:38Z,S21 or s20 FE
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:19:25Z,"Nice job lowering the device price and and the same time remove some feature that I usually don&#39;t pay attention to, like screen resolution and the SD card"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:14:09Z,Watching MKBHD intros remind me of when I was in the theatre and Captain America said &quot;Avengers assemble&quot;

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:11:16Z,People kept complaining about s21 yet they didn&#39;t know the price dropped by 200$. Ignorance people

dhAmMXCBIcg,55,2021-02-03T04:08:24Z,Marques been uploading more frequently and I‚Äôm not against it.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:08:13Z,At ‚Çπ 72000 ($950)  a plastic back is trash. If i pay a premium i demand something that is not a cheap material.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:08:11Z,I&#39;m sooo used to seeing great intros on beebom videos i was barely impressed by this lmaoüòÇ
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:08:07Z,i dont know why i still watch MKBHD reviews when i cant afford any tech he has reviewed
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T04:07:48Z,"Here is how I think Samsung managed to reduce the price this year: they didn&#39;t, for the S21 and S21+. Lemme explain:<br>Samsung just named the successor of the S20 FE as the S21. And the successor of S20 (non plus/ultra) is the S21+. Basically they just changed the naming. Why, do I think so? Because the S21 makes the S21 FE non existent because there is no further compromises that you can do to make its price even lower(They might have to make it with a 765G, 60Hz)."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:07:41Z,"they should have made the s21 as a 5 incher, the s21 plus a 6 incher, the s21 ultra as 7 incher.. or something like that... i need an android small size with high end features, aka iphone 12 mini.."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:07:32Z,"Samsung claimed to have fixed the issues but still, the Exynos sucks as compared to snapdragon. It&#39;s hard to get a snapdragon phone in India. Is it true that Google is gonna make its own silicon in its next flagship"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:07:19Z,So it&#39;s basically the same.  My Galaxy note 2 can do all this....
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:06:40Z,Wth is that intro ü§ê<br>Sick dude
dhAmMXCBIcg,225,2021-02-03T04:06:30Z,"Team MKBHD - &quot;Hey marques, so how innovative and creative do you want the upcoming video intro to be?&quot;<br>Marques - &quot;Yes&quot;"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:06:22Z,"Unpopular Opinion: Intro was great but was a bit too much. Again, I am not saying the intro was bad, but I would rather prefer an intro which doesn&#39;t has too much tacky animations, CGI, and stuff. I really like the intros which has a cool camera shot, maybe even robotic camera arm movement shots, or just a simple transition shot.<br><br>But anyways that&#39;s just my opinion and I can see a lot of people loving this intro, so whatever."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:06:04Z,I love that intro
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:06:03Z,Did he actually say the price of the phone in the video or did he just keep saying &quot;$200 cheaper than last year?&quot;
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T04:05:48Z,amazing intro.. powerful..
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:05:45Z,you and josh valour need to do a collab video..dont care what its about. we&#39;re really just interested in what internet breaking intro your two crazy brains could produce.

dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-03T04:05:40Z,I still think that s20+ sounds like a better deal depending about the price you can get it
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:05:35Z,I didn&#39;t like the plastic back on the note 20 because the price but on the S21 is now $200 cheaper!!!!! That&#39;s a move üôèüèø
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:05:31Z,People make it a big deal just bcz its plastic .<br>the s21 looks gorgeous

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:03:38Z,"The camera should do 2 things better than the 21. The ultra-wide sure. But also the smaller sensor means less fringing on closeup shots, no?"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:01:53Z,why am i just watching the intro?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:01:32Z,Seeing how responsive samsung was to critics and made this phone to combat that I hope that samsung will bring mst back (I don&#39;t really care abt expandable storage because I don&#39;t use that much  space) and yes I know that it&#39;s probably a pipe dream but whatever
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:01:22Z,another view within 4 hours

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T04:00:39Z,I upgraded from the S9 to OP8 Pro and I do miss MST. I had gotten used to not carrying around my wallet.

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T03:58:53Z,Upgraded to the S21 from the S8 and am loving the decision!

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:58:13Z,That intro is FIRE af
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:57:56Z,Samsung is removing more and more features every year. There are becoming an IPhone company without the good stuffs of iphone. I&#39;m switching from Samsung to IPhone after my current S10 plus dies
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:57:43Z,Yooooo I love the outfitss
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:57:19Z,Better lowlight on the S21 since it uses a small megapixel count

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:52:49Z,Nice intro but too long to tell me what the title already did. keep it short.
dhAmMXCBIcg,45,2021-02-03T03:52:46Z,That was just a teaser of what MKBHD can do with his editing skills
dhAmMXCBIcg,23,2021-02-03T03:52:38Z,every time marques points at his head i thought he&#39;s gonna say Big Brain Time
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:52:22Z,I used mst and micro sd ever since my s7 edge. Then went to S8 and currently s10. Will think twice about getting this s21 now.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:49:12Z,I think the 1+ 8pro will do good but with last gen chip or w8 for the 1+ 9

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:47:14Z,No expandable storage or headphone jack is what keeps me with my s10. Next phone won&#39;t be a Samsung because of the lack of expandable storage.

Most phones in 2021 will probably have the same specs and offer even more aggressive prices. That plastic back doesn&#39;t help either."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:32:53Z,I guess its portrait mode because it has low focal length in zoom
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:32:44Z,I didn&#39;t like the 1080 screen on the base S21.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:32:26Z,I noticed!! Between this year&#39;s and last year&#39;s lineup! My Galaxy S20 Plus beats them!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:32:05Z,I&#39;m excited. Now mid range phones should be even cheaper this year. The s21 set the price tone. All the 7 series Qualcomm phones should be cheaper then last year.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:31:55Z,I didn&#39;t deserve that intro
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:31:49Z,Ayyy love to hear that C2C
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T03:31:41Z,MKBHD is still the only one to review a phone a come up with no new information. Only to cover his lack of depth with antics like the intro video or thumbnails. Smh
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:31:40Z,It seems like they took a very similar approach like the note 20 but a lot cheaper I got my notes running about 3 months ago I paid $700 for it it&#39;s been amazing
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:31:39Z,"Great video Marques, did really well"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:31:08Z,A mid roll ad? Hmm I thought you turned those off but I&#39;m happy to fund further projects

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:29:16Z,I&#39;d be fine with a well made plastic back. What&#39;s the downside? Heat transfer? At least it won&#39;t shatter
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:29:12Z,So wich is better still
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:28:39Z,the default is iPhone. get the fact right. the best selling model (not brand).

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:25:53Z,That intro was ona another level
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:25:32Z,"Marques, can you compare the exynos stuff with the Snapdragon stuff, because, till date, the exynos chips have been slower while shipping on the same phones."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:23:32Z,"Honestly this is pretty much the perfect phone imo, if only it ran iOS and had a glass back I would totally change for one of these, but sadly I‚Äôve been trapped by the apple ecosystem and I just can‚Äôt escape anymore!!! This phone look absolutely amazing! And it has soooo many more features than anything else in its price range it is definitely amazing! ‚ÄîObviously, I would love a charger, a headphone jack and expandable storage, but that‚Äôs just unrealistic now a days."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:23:26Z,That intro was sic!

dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-03T03:19:00Z,No expandable storage is actually a big no for me. Hopefully it&#39;s back in S22
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:18:53Z,Clearly no difference from S20 other than the processor upgrade.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:18:48Z,superb

The ultra wide cameras in all three S21s are as wide (according to Samsung, 120 degrees). However, the S21 Ultra has a wider main camera (83 degrees) than S21 and S21+ (79 degrees), therefore the ultra wide camera is 0.6x relative to the main camera on the S21 Ultra, instead of 0.5x on the other two."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:03:47Z,does the S21 have a pre applied built in screen protector?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:03:42Z,Is this phone 120hz right out of the box? Or do you have to switch it from 60 to 120?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:03:33Z,MKBHD: They priced it $200 less!!!<br>Me: Hell! I still can&#39;t afford it.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:03:31Z,MKBHD says you won&#39;t notice the difference between 1080p and 1440p but inside every tech enthusiast mind &quot;But we know that it&#39;s not the same&quot;
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:03:11Z,"I personally don‚Äôt like light phones, makes them feel cheap."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:02:11Z,Everyone is talking about the intro but what about the outro? The music at the end and the outro is perfect
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:02:09Z,I feel like the s20 fe beats the s21 with how good of a deal it is
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:01:53Z,I don&#39;t think people &quot;prefered&quot; 1080 for the 140hz but rather that it was the default resolution so the average consumer didn&#39;t bother to change it. Normal people don&#39;t care about refresh rate as long as the phone just feels fast.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:01:16Z,That intro üî•üî•

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T03:00:11Z,The reson Samsung stuck with a 888 is just to say that they have the fastest chip at this price. Not complaining though.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:53:50Z,You need to make another channel dedicated to Adobe After Effects tutorials because that intro was fire!!!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:53:42Z,Sorry but I just don&#39;t like the metal casing for that camera. It literally shows itself that if you look at it. It kinda destroys the appearance. It is like the hinge at the side of a door. The metal really defeats the glass design.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:53:09Z,Can you do a comparison of the iphone 12 pro vs the S21? They seem to be the closest competition to each other along with the pro max and S21 ultra.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:53:05Z,Wow.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:52:42Z,that intro hit so good
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:52:25Z,The reason why Micro SD is basically useless on new phones is they are too slow.  The fastest SD chip has a read speed of only 100MBps and a write speed of up to 90MBps which is very slow compared to the SSDs that are used as the embedded storage which I believe can offer 1000 MBps.  Why put expandable storage when it‚Äôs far too slow?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:52:17Z,That plastic feels so real JRE mistook it for frosted glass.<br><br><br><b>JRE.</b>

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:45:14Z,It&#39;s overpriced and comes with less features for the price  but still MKBHD recommmends it. By showing the ultra they are making everyone buy this one  . This is a marketing tactics. Where they show people vastly overpriced device and make us buy  overpriced  and one with less features device. Not happy with MKBHD.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:29:32Z,YouTube reviews like these are basically ads. Aren&#39;t they? They are more ad than ads itself.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:24:48Z,That Intro was sick!!!!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:24:43Z,The background music at the beginning is a nice touch. Be careful not to go too loud while speaking though and don‚Äôt drop out of the music altogether so quickly after coming back from the cut away. It was all just a little too jarring for what will be a nice addition to the videos.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:24:18Z,Dat intro can‚Äôt be much more of a thanos

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:13:28Z,He makes cool reviews but dont let it fool you: no expandable storage is an absolute no go and ruins the whole s21 for me. 800 dollar is more than enough to have all in one phone. 800 dollar is more than enough to call any phone flagship. And 800 dollar is still too much for getting less. My old phone samsung a3 2016(!) Had glass back and micro sd slot and 3.5 mm jack. And all for 399 dollar.  These are all just marketing tricks to let us believe &quot;we had to cut it out bla bla bla&quot;. Bullshit. All coud ve been done for even less. It s just all about maximum gain in money with less effort. Thats all
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:13:12Z,This is the one I&#39;m getting. Plastic actually aids durability.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:13:08Z,"I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a great phone but I won&#39;t be considering upgrading to anything until the selfie camera is under the display. You could reasonably buy an s10 or an s20 and hardly notice any difference between it and the s21, but as soon as those interruption-free displays start coming out, we&#39;ll finally have a good reason to upgrade."
dhAmMXCBIcg,40,2021-02-03T02:12:51Z,"Samsung based on &quot;is it that noticeable?&quot; for this model, that&#39;s cool because apparently much attention is not payed to certain features in a phone... Great video üëçüèº"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:12:49Z,aw I used the MST... that&#39;s a bummer for me

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:12:33Z,On Point. Don&#39;t buy what you don&#39;t need! Good price point. Wait a couple of months and you&#39;ll get it cheaper.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:12:01Z,"I don&#39;t mind the plastic or the screen until they didn&#39;t in my opinion reduce the price as much as they did the cost. I would just like to see it a little cheaper, It looks great now but it kind of stands alone atm so we will see how its value ages over the next 10 months."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:11:42Z,"Man, MST was the only reason I would consider a Samsung. Very sad to see it go."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:11:23Z,Random but I wish I could spend one day with Marquess man just to learned some tips on how he records his content. He‚Äôs up there with movie productions.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:08:24Z,The flat screen on the s21 is way better than curved.
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-03T02:08:16Z,"Already missing mst. Got to the FedEx store and forgot my wallet, luckily I had my s10 and was able to pay with it."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:08:06Z,I actually prefer the plastic back. Cause it doesn&#39;t break. I wish we had and ultra this size and weight...
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:08:06Z,"Is it just me, or was the video sped up a smidge? Not a complaint, the more content the better. Just curious."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:08:05Z,So the price of S21 has dropped by 200$? That means the charger is 200$.
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T02:08:01Z,"MST  is a deal breaker for me. The best part of having a Samsung is that you don&#39;t need to cary a wallet. Oh well, I will be giving Apple a try. No more Note, and now this. üò¢ Samsung has last its way."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:07:58Z,"If you are buying this instead of a s20 to save the $200, dont waste more than 10% of that savings on a $25 piece of dbrand skin."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:03:39Z,Is the new intro the work of new staff? It seems like the video upped the channel&#39;s already high standards.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:03:37Z,THAT <b>INTRO!</b>
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:03:06Z,"I prefer phones with plastic backs and flat screens, it&#39;s the entire reason I bought the s20 fe. I always put my phone in a case so a glass back does nothing for me and I have found that curved phones tend to get broken screens far more often and replacement costs are much higher."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:02:41Z,That subtle Sony A1 Camera glance...
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T02:02:33Z,how not to notice NO SD CARD.... yes... I notice
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T02:02:12Z,"Samsung MST is pretty cool, but ApplePay kind of killed it. ApplePay is reaching mass adoption and it is not based on MST.<br>It so makes sense to not supporting MST assuming NFC card readers are the standard."

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T02:01:37Z,I miss MST bro. I would have paid $100 more to have it on this dummy thick ultra premium blablabla phone.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:01:10Z,Would you notice the difference with the S20 FE that currently cost almost half the price?

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:00:58Z,Is it just me or his intros get better every vid
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T02:00:47Z,"Why the heck all tech youtubers receive the Snapdragon version instead of the Exynos ones? Does it seem suspicious from Samsung that these people talk wonders about how the Snapdragon version is the greatest (which is  locked depending on the zone that you love) <br>.... so, for me as a Latinamerican I have to wait months to watch reviews that honestly talk about the lower performance that Exynos provides. And don&#39;t even make me start talking about prices, which are awfully overpriced for a chip which isn&#39;t really the best option. My experience with an Exynos 990 in my S20 has been awful from the start. I couldn&#39;t give it back (poor management from a non Samsung dealership ) and ultimately got me disappointed to say the least.  <br><br>Summarizing,  it wouldn&#39;t kill anybody if Samsung provides both versions of the phone, so youtubers provide the whole experience for everyone."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:57:25Z,Plot twist : the intro is more expensive than the cost of making the s21 ultra...

One gets swayed away by ULTRA but the real application of knowledge is applied by you while reviewing the portrait shot. Appreciated. <br>If Possible please compare the Exynos vs Snapdragon version.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:51:18Z,Aint gone lie... thats basically a Galaxy S20 FE
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-03T01:51:04Z,I still have the intro on loop
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:50:54Z,Did I see a Fuji Camera?!?!
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T01:50:51Z,Me: I need to get better at making videos. <br><br>MKBHD: check this intro out
dhAmMXCBIcg,7,2021-02-03T01:50:44Z,Does anyone know the song? It made that intro smooth as hell.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:50:35Z,The thing about 120hz is that almost nothing we use can output that. Or at least it&#39;s not the norm. For example with the better resolution I can actaully put it to use when I watch videos on YouTube (1440p vids) or games look more clear and bright. Once 120hz is more standard and more people use that on whatever is is they are making then I will agree its better. I really don&#39;t care about apps like fb looking a bit more clear when I scroll and stuff. Plus it takes alot more battery.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:49:59Z,"Paid review. Using s21 for the last one week. Cannot focus on close shot and images get blur. Battery drains fast, overheats, and only  6 hours SOT for a $800 phone!! It also has network issues. üëé"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:49:15Z,"&quot;they checked the right set of boxes&quot;<br>I am sorry but that is wrong. Without the expandable storage, the S series is now just like Iphones which NEVER had that. It was one of the major key differences they had over apple and now they are pretty much a &quot;slightly better&quot; apple phone.<br>I was fine when they removed the IR blaster<br>I was annoyed but still fine when they removed the audio jack and the blood pressure sensor for S-health<br>but the expandable storage is a step WAY too far and You can&#39;t tell me that the expandable storage is the reason why the phones were going up in price. They could have left that in and still kept relatively the same price range."

How can this be? simple, screen is 1080p max, no need to push more pixels to me or offer a better resolution. It looks good because samsung is the best in amoled HOWEVER, i wanted my 1440p that ive been accustomed to for years since like the galaxy note 3 or 4. And not only that but i paid 1000 dollars and i dont get at least a 90fps refresh rate? i figured it was fucking standard. No need for the ultra but nope. 1000 bucks gets you specs from 3-4 years back, just slightly better and no real new features."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:33:43Z,"I will never like android and stay with iPhone until android stops sending personal data to advertises without giving me a cut of their profit, but the device at least looks good, besides the circle of dead pixels at the top of the screen. But the design for the camera bump is gorgeous. Highlight a feature that the creator and consumer are proud of, where it gives a feeling of creativity and capturing adventures. <br>The colors seem strange, but they kinda look good. It‚Äôs not the same feeling I had when Nintendo came out with more than just the gray gameboy, but it‚Äôs still an interesting thing to stare at."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:32:51Z,"This would not work for anybody trying to monitor their Diabetic blood sugars because the new devices rely on NFC to transfer data securely and unlimited. That means people will have to carry around the manufacturer monitor than just scanning with your phone. Most people have their phones with them all the time so they didn&#39;t have to worry if insurance would cover it. Now if you upgrade without NFC, you will have to consider this and if it will become inconvenient for you all over again. Being able to scan as much as you want as long as you have your phone charged is a life saver for all Diabetic people trying to manage the sugars better without having to stick your finger several times a day. Plus you don&#39;t have to write down your numbers for your endocrinologist because it transmits it to them automatically  which allows them to adjust your insulin correctly.  As I researched, I think the Z fold might still be the only phone with NFC, but not sure. You will have to ask when considering to upgrade üòâ üëçüèæ<br>So NFC is something they may want to put back into their phones if they know medical devices are counting on that technology to make it easier for patients with medical disabilities to be monitored much more frequently and accurately. Bluetooth is not secure for medical information but NFC is. So sometimes to consider. I also wish they put back the blood pressure monitoring, not everyone wants a watch around their wrist. Any they should research this before taking things out. <br>Another thing they need to work on is better way to have parental controls on your older kids phones like iPhone does where you can prevent apps from even being downloaded on their separate phones and requests for permissions and real time see what is on their phone. Currently you only are able to put a new browser that can time out and needs your password of the phone to get in. That only works for small children and not older children that still need help in monitoring and shutting down devices at appropriate times and looking at age appropriate things."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:29:50Z,"yup im gonna buy this phone, not sure why I didnt&#39;t pull the trigger when you could get it with the buds pro"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:29:43Z,the thing in price is they OVER INFLATE the fucking price on purpose. This way they can scale it back eventually and start over. Now you think hm its a good investment so maybe ill buy. Its a good deal. uh NO They can easily scale back to 500-600 bucks at still make a healthy profit. Lets not talk about R&amp;D when you know damn well samsung and apple have been at it for well over a decade. By now everything is SUPER streamlined and they know what theyre doing. They over inflate slowly and will scale back to sell more units. I gurantee s22 will be another 100 bucks or so. Its all about seing how much you can milk from the consumer and SEEM fair.. so they keep coming back
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:29:35Z,"The only thing keeping me from buying a Samsung phone is that God awful, ugly, Android skin. If it had stock Android I would hop on it instantly."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:25:58Z,You gotta wonder if they are also taking a lower margin as well on the S21. I don&#39;t see these compromises adding up to 200.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:25:56Z,That intro made me jizz.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:25:28Z,S22 is much better than s21
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:25:20Z,My guess. It&#39;s better at not sounding so cheap because it doesn&#39;t rattle like my s20 ultra??
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:25:12Z,That purple piller with that gray beam looks like Dyson hair dryer üòÅ
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T01:25:07Z,Honestly the lack of 1440p and a micro SD card slot kills it for me even with it being $200 less then the Galaxy S20 it&#39;s still $100 MORE then the Galaxy S20 FE which is the phone I went with and it has the same 1080p screen plus it still has the micro SD card slot. I&#39;m sorry but 1080p is a no go tho at $700 the lower resolution is highly noticeable coming from the Razer Phone 2 with an actual 1440p screen and the high refresh rate 120FPS screen doesn&#39;t really matter all that much and isn&#39;t much of an advantage. For my money the 1440p screen is much better and more useful. As for them going with a weak ass Snapdragon 765G that would have been terrible and absolutely killed the phone that chip is crap in comparison to even the 865 so why would anyone pay an extra $100 over the price of the Galaxy S20 FE just to get a weaker chip no micro SD card storage the same 1080p screen and the same build quality? Honestly the only thing the phone has going for it is the Snapdragon triple 8 other then that it&#39;s completely pointless. The Snapdragon Triple 8 is an emulation beast so if there was any reason I&#39;d get an S21 it would be because of that but yea saying the average user wouldn&#39;t notice the difference in processor is kinda dumb maybe if it was an isheep but I feel Android users actually pay attention to the specs of a phone.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:25:01Z,"I absolutely loathe that Samsung removed MST. Since no one else offers that, my only choice is to stick with my S10+ for as long as it continues to function."

The s10+ was great, they got rid of the notification led but it had a 1tb internal storage. Don&#39;t know why any other Samsung phones after the s10+ didn&#39;t have 1tb storage.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:07:45Z,I would assume Samsung probably did this because of the popularity of Galaxy S20 FE.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:04:41Z,Can you compare the S20FE with the S21?

If this is the way Samsung is going, I will most definitely be looking to switch manufacturers for the first time in about ..... 3 years."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:03:37Z,"Just picked this for my  review, and so far you&#39;re confirming some of my initial thoughts!  This little guy is such a solid little compact beast!"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:03:32Z,I upgraded to the S21 from an S10 and only have 2 issues with the upgrade.  1 this phone is THICK.  If you like thin phones you might want to wait and see what other phones come out this year.  2 is the poorer battery life on the S21 compared to the S10.  I think that 120HZ screen really hurts that battery.  I get through most of the day but the S10 was much better.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T01:03:14Z,Holy mackerel that intro!!!
dhAmMXCBIcg,7,2021-02-03T01:02:52Z,I rewatched that intro like 5 times

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:58:49Z,My only concern for this device is the heating issues I&#39;m having. Maybe it&#39;s just the phone I received on pre order.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:58:39Z,Totally agreed with the potrait mode part. Best portrait mode in any smartphone camera ive seen. In fact some shots are comparable to DSLR.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:58:30Z,Watching on my galaxy S20 fe lol
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:58:18Z,price down and plastic..because lockdowns and ppl not having money to pay the premium.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:58:09Z,"The price is still high and the amount of feature cuts were too many, making the price drop for the S21 just to be competitive. <br>No Charger, 1080p screen...., no MicroSD card and we are back to &quot;high end&quot; plastic phones.<br>In Portugal, S21 5G has pretty much 0 price cut, it has the same high price as before at around 900‚Ç¨ on average, with 1100‚Ç¨ for the Plus variant.<br>Samsung is fcking up and clearly on a down trend. <br>As an owner of a S9+, the S21 has no clear improvements.<br>Unfortunately, there is no proper competition. The high-end market of mobile phones is crap right now in Android and everything is too expensive, all brands clearly milking it now as they run out of ideas. (Please note, my phone history is: S2, S3, S5, S9+. So I&#39;m used to buying high-end).<br>Samsung historically has a &quot;tick tock&quot; phases, where release a couple of years of great phones and then 2 or 3 years of TERRIBLE deals. We are in the bad deals phase."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:57:10Z,S21 portrait mode isn&#39;t as great as you say
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:57:10Z,"That screen will kinda hurt but yeah, for most people its a good sacrifice. I guess I won&#39;t be getting this though. I&#39;ve got this jank VR set up using my s9 and a kinect and the higher resolution actually helps there xD"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:57:10Z,Been using the s21 plus for about a week after upgrading from the s9 and its been amazing. Camera is on a whole new level and adaptive refresh rate looks so smooth I&#39;d take that over 1440p any day
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T00:56:54Z,I agree with everything you said. But no expandable storage is a deal-breaker.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:56:32Z,I&#39;d get one if it had headphone jack. Gonna keep voting with my wallet until there is absolutely no option with a 3.5mm.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:56:22Z,"It&#39;s a really nice phone and I would love to daily drive that thing, but I&#39;m not sure what costumers will buy this. For people that use the phone for browsing internet, social networks and photos/selfies, this phone is no better than pixel or some xiaomi phone for half the price. If someone wants to pay a lot for a smartphone, he wants to get the most high end version, which this phone is not."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:56:08Z,This was the most fun smartphone review I ever watched

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T00:54:55Z,I THINK THAT s21 WILL BE BETTER IN PORTRAITS BECAUSE THE U USES THE 108MP BUT S21 WILL USE 3X ZOOM

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:51:26Z,Firts thing I noticed when I picked this phone up is that plastic on the back feels cheap and front panel missing the curved edges... makes it feel even cheaper. Dissapointed af

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:51:10Z,nastiest intro in a min üî•
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:51:07Z,"Q: which is better,and why? s20 FE OR s21 <br>i hope somebody tried them both tells me"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:50:37Z,The S21 has better zoom quality
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:50:36Z,"On a sourcing/procurement standpoint, using the same chip throughout all their most popular lines probably also gave them a price break to reduce the overall cost of the chip. Having different chips for lower-end phones is probably still cheaper, but the comparison is likely not apples-to-apples in cost difference"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:50:27Z,Dunno why but this video feels a little insincere. Too much praise for a relatively  compromised flagship phone. Brushed the cons away like they were nothing. :/ not okay.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:50:18Z,That intro tho üî•
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:50:05Z,Cool T Shirt
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:50:00Z,Is it just the PH because it is basically the same price as last year. It went down by like $20
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:49:32Z,oh man....portrait mode is the best of any smartphone??? I am an android guy but iPhone just blows every phone out of the water just because of the focal length
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:49:30Z,The reason why most people wont notice between 1440p and 1080p is because nobody can tell the difference.
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T00:49:26Z,"Samsung hit a home run with the S21! They made a very PRACTICAL flagship phone by eliminating the expensive features on the S20 that most people either don&#39;t use or don&#39;t care about and LOWERED the price from $1000 (S20) down to $800 (S21).<br><br>Plastic back - Compared to glass, it&#39;s more durable, lighter and costs less to produce and replace if damaged. I love it!<br><br>SD card - Samsung keeps it simple. With just a $50 upgrade to the 256GB storage option and the cheap access to cloud storage these days, there&#39;s really no need to clutter up new phones with SD card hardware. This lowers the price and complexity of the phone and makes it a bit lighter too.<br><br>Screen resolution - On a 6.2 inch screen 1080p works great! It&#39;s a waste of money to go with any higher resolution. The human eye can&#39;t really tell the difference.<br><br>Flat screen - A superior choice! Curved screens may look good to some but they&#39;re problematic with unwanted touch inputs at the edges. They are also expensive to produce and replace.<br><br>MST - Samsung Pay no longer has MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) on the S21 series but that&#39;s OK! Almost every payment system now has NFC so there&#39;s no longer a need to build expensive tech into newer phones that is NOT needed. MST is history."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:49:11Z,The s21 is legit a refreshed updated version on my s8+. Samsung really tryna make me upgrade
dhAmMXCBIcg,8,2021-02-03T00:49:01Z,I didn‚Äôt know that many of you cared about the intros so much

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:48:31Z,That portrait selfie looked too artificial thoughü§îü§î Samsung needs to work on their selfies. Solid phone nonetheless
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T00:48:28Z,".....they got rid of the main reason why Samsung Pay was more convenient than Apple Pay?......lol yeah I&#39;m sticking with my Note 20 Ultra, and keeping my MST. But this is a compelling phone for people who blah blah blah yeah you got my comment. Carry on."
dhAmMXCBIcg,22,2021-02-03T00:48:20Z,I don&#39;t think we&#39;re gonna see an FE version this time with this thing around.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:47:32Z,"My two year old oneplus 7 pro does 90hz at 1440 all the time. And yeah I can notice the difference if I switch to 1080. On video and images you can&#39;t tell the difference, but on text you get a lot more on the screen at 1440 and I couldn&#39;t to back."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:47:23Z,"I mean no hate to android at all by this comment, but I literally don‚Äôt know a single person with one.

You created a really nice momentum with the music on this one and it would benefit from more 3-7 seconds of it. And I&#39;d also say: those quirky shots that you do sometimes, like the floating phone? Try to make them more &quot;a part&quot; of the review. Like a theme.

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T00:33:18Z,"i don&#39;t get it, Why are smartphones getting more and more expensive? the materials are the same (glass and metal) better displays and more powerful and efficient SOCs that are supposed to get cheeper (due to better silicon yields and enhanced manufacturing process), is it inflation?"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:33:10Z,It‚Äôs like I am having a conversation with you ....loving it
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:33:08Z,"Hey MKBHD, since there seems to be shift towards plastic backs, what do you think the chances are for the return of removable backs &amp; batteries? üôÑ"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:32:19Z,No MST what even the Asieries phones have that and I will not be looking to switch unless that add it back in same for the SD card. Note 20 Ultra for life
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:32:13Z,"Really love the camera bump matt finish. Currently have the 12pro, the camera bump  is glossy that u can see dirt everytime"
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T00:32:07Z,"Next time please compare it to the equivalent iPhone (if there is one). In this case, the iPhone 12 or 12 Mini and for the S21+, the iPhone 12 Pro, and finally, for the S21 Ultra, the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Please do this for the Note series (if there is a new note phone this year) that is going to be coming out within the next few months!"
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T00:32:03Z,"I got mine with buds live for 500 AUD. Def worth it for me, i had s9+"

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T00:31:35Z,Drop the price by only $150 and bring back the micro SD.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:31:31Z,"It&#39;s nice that companies are making a smaller screen phone now, instead of a p tablet size screen phone. I guess the manufacturer forgot this is a phone not a tablet. But I would still like to see all this crammed in a 6-in or 5.8-in phone. Also thank you Samsung for making a flat screen phone."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:31:27Z,This seems like the s20 fe v1.5

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:30:37Z,"1440p on a phone is unnecessary, even 720p on my regular s10 looks amazing, especially since only half is used for videos since people read comments."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:30:18Z,Nice phone but I&#39;ll stick with my Galaxy S20 FE 5G.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:30:16Z,S21 fastest chip in a phone? Is this a paid review?
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T00:30:09Z,"I&#39;m literally in my office taking notes, that intro was NEXT level! ü§Ø ps. if you own the Airpods Max put them on and start the video over.. you&#39;ll thank me later lol"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:29:37Z,Watching this on my new S21. The screen looks great. Processor and memory seem to perform seemlessly. I definitely recommend the phone after my first week with it.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:29:36Z,"Maybe I should update my S10e, I&#39;m a sucker for small phones even though I have big hands."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:29:34Z,Of I would notice now. You pointed it already.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:29:31Z,That intro had no business being that dope.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:29:05Z,Can&#39;t wait for the Note 21 Ultra
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:28:53Z,"I&#39;m typing this on a S21, and I have to say the battery is super underwhelming! It doesn&#39;t last to the end of the day, when my 2 year old S10 would. Marques says his has had no issues, so is there something wrong with mine?"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:26:05Z,I see this phone as a pricier version of the FE from last year rather than a cheaper version of the regular s20 last year.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:26:04Z,In the icon skin ü§§ü§§
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:26:02Z,"Man i really wanted the Macro mode üò¢, isn&#39;t it the same &quot;ultra wide&quot; camera tho?"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:25:58Z,"Watching this video with my S21 üòÅüòÅüòÅ. I love it, it is a winner but I don&#39;t like the camera, it has it worst, photos don&#39;t look sharp like my old S8. I am not photo freak so it doesn&#39;t hurt me."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:25:36Z,Auto focus?<br>Oh it was the Ultar wide that‚Äôs less wide on the Ultra? Ironic lol
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:25:33Z,I love Samsung but this phone is ugly asf that new camera is atrocious. Should of just made the color match.
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T00:25:30Z,No SD card and the choice to remove accessories like charger and headphones makes this phone a major NO. People shouldn&#39;t be paying flagship money for a plastic phone with missing features from previous phones
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:25:26Z,"Samsung is definitely going to use this part <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhAmMXCBIcg&amp;t=463"">7:43</a> for their next advert. Definitely!"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:25:23Z,200$ less after they raised last year by 200$
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:25:18Z,S21 = FE2
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:25:13Z,I dont know much about microphones but I think it sound very similar and pretty good imo.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:25:09Z,With no MST I don&#39;t see a reason to buy Samsung phones anymore.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:25:08Z,We just gon ignore that that color variant is thanos with the infinity gauntlet

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:24:47Z,"Honestly man, it‚Äôs too little and too late. When I switched to apple last year I fully expected to hate it. Thing is... I love it and not going back. Droid had me for a decade and slipped to far for my liking. I hate how something that costs $1k gets 2 years of support tops and then forgotten. Nope."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:24:45Z,i mostly use my s20 with the highest resolution possible rather than refresh rate so im glad i didnt wait till s21 came out<br>removing the option is just silly

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:23:44Z,You gonna make a video for the 21+? There really hasn&#39;t been too much on that version just because there&#39;s minimal differences between the Standard and the +. Id still wanna know if you&#39;d reccomend it or not for the price its at.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:23:41Z,MKBHD never uses dark mode on his phones bruh
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:23:40Z,I hate the new look of these phones. I loved the s10 and s20 but the s21 is ugly as fuck. That gold does not match the rest of the phone at all and I hate how it curves around only on one side
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:23:38Z,"You mean in order to have an excuse to take out some features, they lowered down the prices of the phone which they, too, bumped up SUPER high in the beginning???<br><br>Lucky us."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:17:29Z,I would rather the phone was slightly thicker to remove the bump. Maybe that&#39;s just me. And surely it could help with cooling and/or increase the battery capacity.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:17:28Z,The camera looks like it‚Äôs clipped on there like a third party attachment

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:17:03Z,I would like to see the s21 in the icons recode skin. It looks great in the triple black and I like the idea of leaving the camera not covered. I think I will do that too.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:16:56Z,"Yeah the prices dropped because features were dropped. If the price hadn&#39;t dropped it would just be an outright scam- lack of micro SD card, crappy 1080p display, plastic back (whilst not bad is cheap on a flagship phone- Galaxy S10 and the previous gen lineups were also the same price when launched holding no features back and didn&#39;t skimp on build materials). The justification of them dropping features to get back to the reasonable price point they were at 3 years ago is ridiculous"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:15:55Z,love the intro
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:15:53Z,"We need more Android &quot;right&quot; sized phones like the S21 that are also high end flagships.  I realize it&#39;s not quite Ultra feature wise but it does seem like Samsung did make the right decisions on what features are ultimately necessary for this phone to still be considered &quot;flagship&quot; material.  Although I wouldn&#39;t mind an S21 Ultra &quot;Petite&quot;; all the features in an S21 sized tight package.  <br><br>I really hope Google and other Android manufacturers are paying attention.  As much praise as Google received for the Pixel 5 for making a value oriented flagship, I found it to be underwhelming as a &quot;flagship&quot; for the full retail price point.  I also hope this outsells S21+ model so that Android manufacturers will realize not every phone needs to be sized like a small tablet.  I think these approx. 6&quot; sized phones are the sweet spot of sizeable screen without feeling like a sizeable phone.  <br><br>Well done Samsung you&#39;ve earned to take my hard earned money."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:15:46Z,Just watching this video (and Ultra one too) to see what the iPhone 17 will have. Just can‚Äôt bring myself to buy a Samsung cuz I need a phone that will still run smoothly after 3 years.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:14:57Z,Honestly I think the s21 line up is the best since the s9 family

dhAmMXCBIcg,7847,2021-02-03T00:13:23Z,Pretty much every MKBHD intro: how did he do that?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:13:21Z,"I got the S21+ and it&#39;s just too big and awkward, doesn&#39;t entirely fit in a pocket. The Ultra is crazy money for a better camera zoom. The price difference between the S21 and Ultra would buy a compact standalone camera that would blow away any smartphone. The S21 is really the pick of the lineup."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:12:39Z,"Theres more simpler explanation why would they drop the price.. and make the &#39;supposed&#39; Fan edition into a standard S21; 2020 fucked up every fortune companies out there, because of pandemic, sales are down, so they need to create something much cheaper to reach people even on their standard flagship phones, i don&#39;t know the numbers of their loses but this is pretty much something a company would do if they just had a huge lost in sales. Look at Nintendo on 3DS launch way back, they cut the prices within 6 months because of sales lost too.<br><br>Or if the reason is not sales lost, this is their new way of saying that &quot;standard edition is cost cutting version now, deal with it&quot; üòÇ i mean, at least apple puts &quot;mini&quot; on their version to let you know that.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:06:32Z,Samsung is the perfect example of why pixel 5 is a terrible phone. They could have easily put the latest processor in the same price. But they got way too greedy. Google is the worst!
dhAmMXCBIcg,2,2021-02-03T00:06:31Z,That Daft Punk art in the background is so incredible... I want one so badly üò¢

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T00:06:14Z,"come on man, the s21 is the s10e equivalent, so stop saying it&#39;s cheaper"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:05:58Z,FINALLY!!! a reviewer that does not keep telling that samsung cameras are &quot;over saturated&quot;<br>it-is-not-the-case-anymore. Samsung has already fixed this issue.<br>A LOT of youtubers are used to say the &quot;over saturated&quot; cameras on samsung phones through the years. it&#39;s already a cliche&#39;<br>a very reasonable review
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:05:54Z,"I doubt I&#39;ll buy it since they use the shitty Exynoss chip in my country and the lack of a charger, unless it goes on a big sale near black friday. I was actually looking forward to buying a phone with fast charging as I don&#39;t have that on my current one, but now they&#39;re not even including the charger as if fast charger isn&#39;t a thing anymore? I&#39;m really looking forward to what OnePlus has in store, and can&#39;t wait for what they do with the charger. Hopefully it also has a good camera. If they drop the charger then that&#39;s a major loss for them."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:05:53Z,"The production value of these videos is getting better every time, and it doesn&#39;t stop. Like Samsung&#39;s portrait mode ü§£"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:05:51Z,"It‚Äôs funny, I have my s10+ and it feels like a better phone in almost every way. Every year Samsung removes more features and dumbs the phone down and I am sitting here with my s10+ with its headphone jack, expandable storage, that credit card spoofer tech, all the bells and whistles like ultra wide and reverse wireless charging, a great camera, great battery life... üòÇ they could literally releaSe the s10+ next year and it would feel like a leap compared to the more recent S line phones ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br><br>The s10+ was the pinnacle of the S line, its only going backwards from here baby. Another year and another 5 reasons why I‚Äôm not getting rid of my s10 üòÜ"
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T00:05:51Z,"I like the design of this phone better than the ultra (no curved screen, slimmer camera box) and would totally get it if it had the space zoom feature (idc about multiple wide angles, I just want the zoom), a better resolution display and the s-pen support would be nice but isn&#39;t as needed. I hate that they took away the charging brick, the SD support and MST. Those are the primary reasons I probably will just skip these s21 phones completely even though they are the most appealing by far that samsung has ever made. I know I can get some of those features like the screen and micro sd at least in a phone from Sony, Asus, or another brand."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:05:20Z,"I feel Samsung should&#39;ve dropped the phone&#39;s price by more here in the UK considering that the S21 Ultra is the same price as last year&#39;s S20 Ultra launch price for just 128gb more, meaning that while the US gets a price drop, the UK gets a price freeze."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:05:16Z,Literally just got the s21 set up today. Coming from a Google pixel 2 XL. It seems really solid so far and I&#39;m excited to see what the camera can do!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:05:13Z,Oled display 400 ppi is equivalent to about 300 ppi of rgb display.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:04:29Z,"dude, I like you, I&#39;m subscribed, I watch every video. But how much did samsung pay you for this infomercial to get you to make claims like &quot;fastest chip in a phone&quot; and saying 1080p is great?"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:04:25Z,IMO phones stopped getting meaningfully different at the S10 plus.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:04:25Z,People would rage if apple did the same......samsung is even shittier tbh
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:04:24Z,"I also thought the design was okay the first time I saw it. I didn&#39;t hate it, but I didn&#39;t like it, either. It grew on me, though. It grew so much that most other phones look so bland to me rn. I love all the specs, but the main reason I&#39;m buying an s21 is because of the design. It&#39;s just so good! I love it!"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:04:07Z,The worlds best intro
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:04:01Z,I love the new idea of making a phone cheaper by using a plastic back. Instead of making more changes inside the phone. I&#39;d buy a $200 cheaper iphone if it had a plastic back over the glass back any day.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:04:00Z,How do I get one?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:03:58Z,disappointed he didn‚Äôt talk about recording videos in the review... I use my iPhone 12 Pro for vlogging and want to switch back to Android but I feel like Apple can‚Äôt be beat when it comes to recording videos
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:03:56Z,"Looks pretty sick. In anyones opinion, is it worth upgrading from my s10+? The s20 didnt seem like it but this one looks like more of a jump up for me."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:03:41Z,Auto-like for the killer intro
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:03:35Z,200?...Not enough!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:03:30Z,Thank you for mentioning the lack of MST! Tbh that was a biggg reason why I have a Samsung phone.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:03:28Z,I wish they had a glass back option for a little more money.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:03:28Z,sick intro dude

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-03T00:02:40Z,See I&#39;m upset about the no sd card slot yet I&#39;m yet to use the one in my s10e. Definitely still not chuffed they dropped it though
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:02:31Z,"Samsung deserves the top spot for smartphones. Their phones are obviously better and they try as much to improve their phones per-model. Not gimmicky improvements but real leaps. Just look at the Exynos 2100, it&#39;s almost on par with the SD888."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:02:25Z,"I don&#39;t care what they say. There <b>*are*</b> no excuses to have a plastic back on a phone that costs more than 300 dollars. There are also no excuses to have a sub-1440p panel on a phone over 600 dollars. <br><br>My S9+ shouldn&#39;t be better than the S21 in any regard, but it is, in several."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:02:24Z,"yeah i upgraded and did my pre-order, very huge jump from my s9 to s21 by like 12 numbers. happy with my choice"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:02:18Z,That intro is one of the best I&#39;ve seen in a long time!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:02:15Z,Can you do a comparison between the Plus and Ultra please. Especially how much bigger the Ultra is. Thanks.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:02:12Z,"I wish Samsung would stop removing stuff from their phones. Headphone jack, now expandable memory, mst, lower resolution panels, headphone and charger in the box. Samsung used to be the company that would give you more for your money. Why is it that xiaomi can include everything Samsung does and more and give all the accessories and all the features Samsung keeps removing, while still undercutting them in price."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:02:12Z,Looveeee the intro

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-03T00:01:53Z,Honestly the biggest bust is the sd card i got one with literally everything I got in my previous phone really hate how they follow apple with stupid ideas to make cash

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:59:25Z,"lighter phones are easier to handle. The time has come to abandon heavy glass backs.<br>Carbon fiber for the high end, plastic for the rest."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:59:20Z,"Here&#39;s the problem. Samsung dropping all of those make them just like all the rest. What reason do I have to stay loyal to Samsung like I have for years now since the Note 3? I&#39;m not huge into photography, so as long as pictures I take aren&#39;t a blurry mess, I&#39;m fine with it. Sure, the price is cheaper, but there are even cheaper phones now that can do what Samsung does. They&#39;ve removed all the extra features that kept me with them."

Five years after the S7 and only double the RAM? Makes me worry that I couldn&#39;t use the S21 for the same amount of time."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:59:01Z,The intro graphics are just getting ridiculous now.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:58:57Z,1. The s21 does not has any focusing issues because it has the Dual Pixel AF and doesn&#39;t need this stupid Laser-AF.<br>2. The Telephoto is NOT a telephoto! It&#39;s pure fake and it&#39;s so annoying that no one criticizes Samsung for that at all.<br>3. The Ultra wide is not wider. It say 0.5x instead of 0.6x because the MAIN lense is narrower. The S21 ultra main camer has a 24mm compared to the 26mm of the S21. That&#39;s why it&#39;s 0.5x on the S21 - it&#39;s the same 13mm.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:58:51Z,Well said! Phone is very balanced.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:57:02Z,"It sounds like it&#39;s full of excuses. Is it really worth $800? I can get a Samsung phone almost as good for far less or I can get Android phone from another manufacturer for cheaper that is more of a premium phone for less. I don&#39;t understand this phone at this price range. It feels like we spent a lot of time justifying the cut corners, but the price cut isn&#39;t enough to justify those cut corners."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:57:01Z,So shallow and superficial...

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:55:26Z,i¬¥m sure the S21 has better low light than the S21 ultra like the S20 had compared to the S20 ultra. Because the S21 Ultra still sucks in that point with its 108mp sensor.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:53:46Z,I swear everyone was mad at that Apple for giving the iPhone XR and 11 a 1080p but now that Samsung put a 1080p screen it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot that bad‚Äù....

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:53:29Z,I feel like funneling people to by the enthusiast to buy the more expensive version is putting people back in their place to an extent. Non-enthusiasts don‚Äôt use these things  and if they do it‚Äôs because a video told them to. Not naturally looking at all of the features on their own.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:53:25Z,Lol MST sounds like the most American feature ever. Anywhere else they still have magnetic stripe terminals?
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-02T23:53:24Z,am i the only one who noticed the jump in the quality of this intro ? is this a youtube video :o
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:53:24Z,"Samsung is very smart, they drop the regular one early and then every other company is gonna come hard all year at the s21 but then at the end of the year Samsung will drop the FE version and that will be one of the best phones of the year lol they might have figured it out"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:53:23Z,new oppo please
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:53:23Z,Hope this pushes Oneplus to step up their camera game on their Oneplus 9. They can&#39;t charge $750 when this exists for $50 more with a superior camera and has a 120hz AMOLED screen. No way could Oneplus get away with charging $900-1000 for the Oneplus 9 Pro just to offer a better camera which barely competes with the S21 while the base OP9 has an average camera system.

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:52:57Z,Do you think other companies make some last minute changes to their upcoming phones based on the Galaxy S series each year?

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:51:59Z,"I would sorely miss the lack of expandable storage. I use it for my music collection. I&#39;ve paid for my music in various formats over the decades, so I&#39;m not interested in paying to get it from a streaming service. Besides, no streaming service is adequate, since a great deal of my music is from local artists who are not big commercial names.<br><br>Also, kept my Gear S3 Frontier for the MST."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:51:10Z,That camera bump isn&#39;t growing on me no matter how much I try to like it. üòÇ The Note 20 just hit the sweet spot thst it&#39;s hard to look at anything else. Especially the colored ring accents on the lenses. Xiaomi&#39;s Mi10 series has a good one as well.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:51:08Z,I‚Äôm guessing the s21 has better low light! Could be a larger sensor due to more room and focus on less cameras or faster optics
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:51:08Z,"In my country (Indonesia) the price for S21 same as S20. What really confuse me they still not open PO for S21, while S21+ and S21 Ultra PO already start from global launch"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:50:36Z,I think the Galaxy S21 Ultra is better than S21 and S21+ and if you have S20 or S20+ you&#39;ll see no difference in my opinion Samsung should release for example S21 Ultra and S21 Fold and that&#39;s enough but I like the frosted glass on Galaxy S21 ultra and galaxy note 20 ultra too much I wish you could Subscribe

dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-02T23:48:22Z,ƒ∞t can be the best midrange phone of the year . ofcurse it needs more updates for camera and exynos optimization.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:48:20Z,This came out 10 mins ago?? I&#39;m never this early...stay safe everyone!

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:48:17Z,The visuals in this video are so damn awesome.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:48:10Z,I think you should compare the s20 FE to the s21. There is a $100 difference between the two right now and I don&#39;t think there was that big of a jump yet. I&#39;m sure soon the FE will be discounted lower but the idea still stands
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:48:09Z,Shouting out Teddy Fresh woooo

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:47:48Z,I&#39;m guessing it still does auto focus better than the ultra
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:47:47Z,I hate the fact that it still has a chin! <br>Wtf Samsung! They can&#39;t make an even bezel or bezel less phone in 2021 ugh it&#39;s ridiculous!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:47:44Z,Early squad
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:47:39Z,"Purchasing an iPhone it&#39;s already known that you purchase the brand, not tech. So sad that Samsung is almost there, with little improvements but super high prices. <br><br>So glad the other manufactures are emerging so fast :)"

I don&#39;t miss the things that are &quot;missing&quot; and If I did, I could have easily just shelled out another $400. But it just wasn&#39;t worth it. The S21 is my new favorite!

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:46:56Z,"It goes to show that they never really needed to price their devices so high in the first place, they&#39;re rolling them out quickly, but why so expensive? People really need to stop wasting money"
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:46:55Z,Just picked one up yesterday. So good
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:46:52Z,Im very happy with my S21 Ultra. Upgraded from a Huawei P20 Pro. <br>Waiting for my camera skin to add a little bit of carbon fiber tones to the sexy Phantom Black phone ;)
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:46:50Z,I think what it does better is‚Ä¶ focus.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:46:49Z,A good balance is all you need. Go S21!
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:46:49Z,Correction: 888 is still not close enough to compare against the A14. Running most any benchmarks sets the A14 10% above.
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:46:46Z,"Thank you, i was waiting for this information."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:46:21Z,no i probably would not
dhAmMXCBIcg,1,2021-02-02T23:46:18Z,"The S21 is fine for the simple and average consumers, but I would go for the S21 Ultra 512GB; as I&#39;m more of an advance and heavy user.  Samsung also has token away the micro SD card expansion. Which is a bummer; otherwise having a 256GB would be fine for me."
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:46:16Z,Will you review the sony a1 that you showed in the video?
dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:46:08Z,i almost thought this video is not coming

Plastic(i don&#39;t use a case), no headphone jack(i mean are u serious??), no charger, no sd card slot, small harddrive. To be honest, i&#39;m just sad that i have to change to Asus next year if they keep up the same line with their phones. Even the displays don&#39;t seem that impressive right now comparing to 2 years ago or so. Am i the only S-series fan who thinks that way ?"

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:45:25Z,"That moment when you have to compromise on a phone that&#39;s still $800 / $900 ...<br><br>Imo the S21 is actually the successor of the S20 FE and NOT of the S20. And from that perspective, it&#39;s actually more expensive."

dhAmMXCBIcg,0,2021-02-02T23:45:15Z,I LOVE my S21! Went from a S20+ to an S21 because I just couldn&#39;t stand how big the 20+ was anymore and I couldn&#39;t be happier. Hand satisfaction is a real thing haha.
